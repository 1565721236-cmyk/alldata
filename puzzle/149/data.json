        "<h3><img src=\"149_content_1.jpg\"></h3>\n<h3>Establishment or Years in Business</h3>\n<p>An excellent place to start when determining the quality of your potential moving company is looking at its years in business or the operator&rsquo;s years of experience. Regardless of the age of an individual company, ensure the owners or directors have at least several years of operating within the industry.</p>\n<h3>Reputation</h3>\n<p>Checking online resources and talking with friends and neighbors is excellent for getting the scoop on your candidate companies. Ask about their experiences when working with their last mover, as well as pricing, customer service and overall comfort level during their move.</p>\n<h3>Reliability</h3>\n<p>There are a couple of tricks you can use to discover the reliability of your candidate moving companies. Check the <a href=\"http://bbb.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Better Business Bureau</a> website for the company&rsquo;s overall grade. A high grade, such as an A or A+, typically means the company is responsive when its customers have a complaint or concern. Read some of the reviews to determine how you feel about the types of complaints customers have.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a> (FMCSA) may also list your mover if it travels between states and this can provide insight into a company&rsquo;s legitimacy. Also, check online and local review platforms for overall customer happiness.</p>\n<h3>Pricing</h3>\n<p>The cost of your move can vary widely between moving companies. However, there are a few things to keep in mind.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pricing variables can differ significantly between moving companies.</li>\n<li>Price quotes come in multiple types, from binding to non-binding to hourly.</li>\n<li>Additional services have differing costs that vary by company.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When shopping for a mover, the best approach is to get at least three quotes from three different companies and compare based on price and service features within that cost range. Remember, the lowest price isn&rsquo;t always the best value, and be wary of extremely low quotes.</p>\n<h3>License and Insurance</h3>\n<p>All moving companies require licensure and insurance of some sort. You can check a company&rsquo;s status on your state&rsquo;s business information websites. Also, ask your mover for a copy or proof of its business license and insurance. Reputable companies will be happy to honor your request.</p>\n<h3>Services and Features</h3>\n<p>Moving companies offer a variety of services over and above getting your stuff from here to there. For instance, if you need to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/moving-services/best-car-shipping-companies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">move a vehicle</a>, identify a mover who can perform the service along with your move instead of seeking a second provider to do the additional work.</p>\n<p>Typical moving services may include vehicle moving, large and fragile item moving, full-service packing and unpacking, cleanup services, moving supply availability, insurance options, storage and more.</p>\n<h3>Availability</h3>\n<p>In addition to choosing a moving company that does business in your area, you&rsquo;ll also need to find one that provides the services you want on the timeline you need. Booking your move as early as possible is helpful. During prime moving months like May, June, and July, you&rsquo;ll compete with plenty of other movers, so availability shrinks, especially over the weekends. However, some movers can make themselves available on short notice. Choose an available mover that can stay on schedule for your move based on reviews, reputation and reliability.</p>"
