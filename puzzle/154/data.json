Basic Knowledge of Tree Care </strong></h2>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. Pruning and Shaping </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Regular pruning is a crucial part of tree care. By pruning, you can remove dead and diseased branches, improve air circulation and sunlight penetration, and promote new growth. Pruning times and methods vary among different tree species. For example, deciduous trees are generally pruned during their dormant period to minimize impact on growth, while evergreen trees can be pruned appropriately during the growing season. For ornamental trees, shaping according to the desired form, such as spherical or conical shapes, can enhance the landscape effect. When pruning, use sharp and clean tools to avoid wound infections.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Pest and Disease Control </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Understanding the symptoms of common tree pests and diseases is key to timely prevention and treatment. Aphids, for instance, gather on tender leaves to suck sap, causing leaf curling; long - horned beetles bore into tree trunks, affecting the tree's structural stability. Integrated pest management methods, including physical, biological, and chemical control, can be employed. Physical control includes manual pest removal and installing insect - proof nets. Biological control utilizes natural enemies of pests, like releasing predatory insects. When using chemical control, apply pesticides cautiously, select appropriate agents and application times, and follow safety guidelines to prevent harm to the environment and human health.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>3. Fertilization and Soil Management </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Trees require sufficient nutrients to grow. Reasonable fertilization meets their nutritional needs. Select suitable fertilizers and application methods based on the tree's growth stage and soil fertility. Generally, spring is the vigorous growth period for trees, so applying nitrogen - rich fertilizers in moderation can promote leaf and branch growth. In autumn, increasing the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers can enhance the tree's cold resistance. Meanwhile, keeping the soil loose and breathable is vital. Regularly loosen the soil to improve its structure and facilitate root growth. For acidic or alkaline soils, soil amendment is necessary according to the tree species' preferences.</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"> </h2>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>II.
