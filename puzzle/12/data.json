    "section": "What Are Supermarket Services (Fresh Delivery & Personal Shopping)?\nSupermarket services encompass a range of convenience-oriented offerings designed to simplify grocery shopping, with two key components: fresh food delivery and personal shopping (errand ). Fresh delivery involves the direct shipment of fresh produce, meats, dairy, and other perishables from supermarkets to customers’ homes. Personal shopping, or errand 代购，involves hiring a dedicated shopper to select, purchase, and deliver items (including non-fresh goods like pantry staples, household products, or specialty items) on behalf of customers who are unable to visit the store themselves. These services leverage technology and logistics to save time, enhance accessibility, and cater to busy lifestyles.",
