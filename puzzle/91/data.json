It is a shining artistic pearl in the southern hemisphere.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Design and construction process:</strong></p><p>Design background: In the early 1940s, the Australian government launched a plan to promote national cultural development, with the construction of an opera house becoming a focus of attention. Since 1955, the government has publicly solicited architectural design works. By the end of 1956, architects from 32 countries submitted 233 works. On January 29, 1957, the design proposal of Danish architect Johann Wu Zhong defeated other competitors and won first place. There are many theories about his design inspiration, some say it comes from orange petals, while others say it comes from sails of sailboats and shells of marine organisms.</p><p>Difficult construction: Construction began in March 1959, but progress was slow, costs exceeded budget, and the project was delayed. In 1965, the Labour government that supported the opera house project stepped down, and the newly elected Liberal government accused the previous government of waste, refused to increase the budget, and terminated the contract with Yoon Woo Chong. Yoon Woo Chung resigned and returned to his home country in 1966, when the project was less than a quarter completed. Later, the Australian government appointed three domestic architects to complete the remaining project. After 16 years of hardships and twists and turns, the Sydney Opera House was completed in October 1973, with a total project cost of over 1 billion Australian dollars, 15 times the design budget. On October 20, 1973, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom cut the ribbon and unveiled the completion of the opera house.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Architectural features:</strong></p><p>Unique appearance: The Sydney Opera House features three sets of massive shell like structures standing on a giant granite pedestal surrounded by the sea on three sides. The shells are arranged layer by layer, with some facing the bay and others facing away from it, like two sets of inverted clam shells. The surface of the shell is covered with white grid glazed magnets, resembling two huge white sailboats in the sunlight, hence it is also known as the \"Sail Roof Theater\".</p><p>Internal layout: The entire building complex covers an area of 1.84 hectares, with a length of 183 meters, a width of 118 meters, and a height of 67 meters. The highest point of the building reaches an altitude of 60 meters. The large staircase in front of the door is 97 meters long and paved with peach red granite. There are a total of six performance venues in the opera house, including the music hall, opera hall, theater hall, drama hall, broadcasting hall, and Wusong hall, as well as a large public restaurant and creative center. The entrance is located at the southern end, and below the platform are vehicle passages and parking lots.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Function and Status:</strong></p><p>Art Palace: The Sydney Opera House is a world-renowned performing arts center that hosts hundreds of performances annually, covering various forms of art such as opera, ballet, concerts, and drama. This place attracts artists and audiences from all over the world, and many world-class performances are held here. It is a coveted performance venue for artists and an excellent place for audiences to enjoy art.</p><p>Cultural symbol: The Sydney Opera House is not only a cultural landmark of Australia, but also listed as a World Heritage Site, becoming a symbol of Australian culture and a source of pride for Sydney citizens. It has played an extremely important role in promoting the development of Australia's cultural industry and has earned Australia a high reputation on the world cultural stage.</p><p>Architectural paradigm: Its unique architectural design style is renowned worldwide and is an outstanding representative of modern architecture in the 20th century. It has had a profound impact on the development of modern architecture and provided rich inspiration and reference for future architects.</p><p><br></p><p>In short, the Sydney Opera House, with its unique design, outstanding functionality, and significant cultural status, has become an artistic treasure in the southern hemisphere and even worldwide, emitting eternal charm.</p>"
