AI and ML can help penetration testers carry out vulnerability scanning and analysis more efficiently and automatically identify potential security risks. For example, using AI algorithms to analyze a large amount of network traffic data can quickly find abnormal behaviors and potential attack signs. At the same time, some automated penetration testing tools are constantly emerging. These tools can conduct a comprehensive detection of the system in a short time, improving testing efficiency. However, it should be noted that automated tools cannot completely replace manual penetration testing, because complex business logic vulnerabilities and some new attack methods still need manual in - depth analysis and verification.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"> </p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">2. </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Growing Demand Driven by Compliance</strong>: Globally, more and more industry regulations and standards require enterprises to conduct regular penetration testing to ensure data security and compliant operations. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) stipulates that enterprises involved in credit card transaction processing must conduct regular penetration testing. This compliance requirement has prompted many enterprises to include penetration testing in their regular security management processes, promoting the continuous growth of the penetration testing market. With the increasing awareness of data privacy protection, more industries and regions may introduce similar regulations in the future, further expanding the market demand for penetration testing.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"> </p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">3. </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Emerging Demand for Cloud Service Penetration Testing</strong>: As more and more enterprises migrate their businesses to the cloud, the security of cloud services has become crucial. The demand for cloud penetration testing has also grown rapidly. Due to the complexity and particularity of the cloud environment, traditional penetration testing methods may not be fully applicable to cloud services. Therefore, penetration testing technologies and tools specifically for cloud services are constantly developing. Both cloud service providers and enterprises using cloud services need to conduct cloud penetration testing to ensure data security and business continuity in the cloud environment. For example, some cloud service providers, in order to enhance customers&rsquo; trust in their services, will take the initiative to invite professional penetration testing teams to test their cloud platforms and disclose the test results to show the security of their cloud services.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"> </p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Practicality, Costs, and Basic Security Protection </strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">1. </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Practicality</strong>: Penetration testing is highly practical. It can realistically simulate hacker attacks, allowing enterprises to intuitively understand the security status of their own systems. Through the vulnerabilities and problems found in penetration testing, enterprises can carry out targeted repairs and improvements, thus effectively improving the security of the system. For example, after a penetration test, an enterprise found that the account password policy for its internal employees was too simple and easy to crack. The enterprise then strengthened the password policy, requiring employees to set complex passwords and change them regularly, which greatly reduced the risk of account cracking. In addition, the results of penetration testing can also be used as cases for enterprise security awareness training to improve employees&rsquo; security awareness and prevention capabilities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"> </p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">2. </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Costs</strong>: The cost of penetration testing varies depending on many factors, including the type and scope of the test, the complexity of the target system, and the charging standards of the service provider. Generally speaking, network penetration testing costs relatively more because it needs to conduct a comprehensive detection of the entire network infrastructure. The cost of web application penetration testing and mobile application penetration testing is relatively lower, mainly depending on the scale and complexity of the application. In addition, choosing different service providers can also lead to large cost differences. Some well - known leading service providers may charge relatively more due to their strong technical strength and high service quality. But in the long run, finding and solving security problems in advance through penetration testing to avoid huge losses caused by real attacks is actually a very cost - effective investment. When choosing a penetration testing service, enterprises should comprehensively consider the cost and service quality and choose the most suitable plan for themselves.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"> </p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">3. </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Coordination between Basic Security Protection and Penetration Testing</strong>: Basic security protection measures, such as firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and antivirus software, are the first line of defense for enterprise network security. They can block most common network attacks, but may not be able to effectively prevent some complex and targeted attacks. Penetration testing can make up for the shortcomings of basic security protection. By simulating real attacks, it can find security vulnerabilities hidden in the deep system. Basic security protection and penetration testing should cooperate with each other to form a complete network security protection system. For example, after deploying basic security equipment such as firewalls, enterprises conduct regular penetration tests, optimize and adjust the firewall rules according to the test results, so that they can better resist external attacks. At the same time, the vulnerabilities found in penetration testing can also provide a basis for the upgrading and improvement of basic security protection equipment, thus continuously improving the overall network security protection level of enterprises.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"> </p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Penetration testing plays a vital role in the field of cybersecurity. Understanding the core types and scenarios of penetration testing, global leading service providers, market trends, as well as the relationship between practicality, costs, and basic security protection is of great significance for enterprises and organizations to formulate effective cybersecurity strategies. By making rational use of penetration testing services, enterprises can find and solve security risks in advance, and ensure their information security and stable business operation in an increasingly complex network environment.</span></p>\n</div>"
