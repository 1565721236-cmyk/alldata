In a sneak peek at the two-part reunion below, shots are fired even before the group sits down with host <a href=\"https://ew.com/person/andy-cohen/\" target=\"\">Andy Cohen</a> as Hubbard is heard saying that Radke \"told a lot of lies.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Of course, Radke shares his side with producers: \"There's been quite a few things since we broke up that just aren't true.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Before hitting the reunion couch, Gabby Prescod says she hopes Radke is \"s---ing his pants right now.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Thankfully, it appears that Radke's pants are still intact during the reunion, but he's certainly in the hot seat. Right off the bat, Cohen asks the group if they think Radke was \"afraid\" of Hubbard. Every single person — including Hubbard, Radke, and Cohen — raises their hand.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The show of hands may have brought a moment of levity, but that moment is short-lived. Radke explains that he didn't plan to break up with Hubbard.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">\"I'd hoped it would maybe go differently,\" he says as Hubbard's mouth falls open.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">\"He told me that he had to <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/summer-house-lindsay-hubbard-carl-radke-call-off-engagement-cancel-wedding/\" target=\"\">have the cameras there</a>,\" Hubbard insists, referring to their breakup, as Radke shakes his head.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">While Radke and Hubbard begin with a measured response to one another, they don't stay calm for long.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">\"You have the apartment,\" he tells Hubbard. \"I paid half the rent for nine months!\"</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Hubbard's not impressed and asks Radke if he wants a \"pat on the back for that?\"</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Meanwhile, Hubbard reveals she is seeing someone new who has <em>not </em>seen the show.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><a href=\"https://ew.com/summer-house-danielle-olivera-lindsay-hubbard-wedding-8601833\" target=\"\"><em>Watch Summer House's Danielle Olivera reveal if she was invited to Carl and Lindsay's (doomed) wedding</em></a></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Of course, the entire reunion isn't packed with only Hubbard and Radke drama because there's plenty to go around with other cast members.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Newcomers Jesse Solomon and West Wilson acknowledge that they hit some bumps this season. Solomon admits coming in late and then hitting on Paige DeSorbo was a bit of a miss. While Solomon took his lumps on camera, Wilson says his relationship indecision with Ciara Miller got him in trouble with fans.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">\"The Bravo fanbase is all women,\" Wilson explains. \"There were just these things that I never—\"</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">\"Too many temptations?\" suggests Amanda Batula.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Batula also addresses her journey of finding her voice in the shadow of husband Kyle Cooke.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">\"I was becoming depressed and I could see how he felt lonely because I felt lonely, too,\" she tearfully says about her marriage.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><img src=\"35_content_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-href=\"\" style=\"\"></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em><strong>Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.</strong></em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">And then there's the feud that was apparently brewing when DeSorbo reveals that \"you guys\" came for her, meaning Danielle Olivera. Olivera lashes out at DeSorbo, saying that DeSorbo's confessionals are not funny to which DeSorbo cracks, \"They are hilarious.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><a href=\"https://ew.com/drew-barrymore-hosts-painting-class-halfnaked-summer-house-stars-carl-radke-kyle-cooke-8580504\" target=\"\"><em>Drew Barrymore hosts painting class with half-naked Summer House stars Carl Radke and Kyle Cooke</em></a></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">\"They are damaging,\" snipes Olivera.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">And that's only a few minutes of a two-part reunion.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Part one of the two-part<em> Summer House </em>reunion airs<em> </em>on Thursday, June 6, at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Bravo.
