    "section": "Cruise travel offers a unique blend of relaxation, exploration, and convenience, with two primary experiences: ocean cruises (sailing across vast seas and oceans) and river cruises (navigating inland waterways through cities and landscapes). Each provides distinct adventures, catering to different preferences—from the grand scale of ocean liners to the intimate charm of riverboats.
