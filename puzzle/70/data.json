Lush rainforests, towering volcanoes exploding into the sky, and shimmering turquoise lakes provide stunning backdrops for your shots.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Step back in time with captivating Mayan ruins like Tikal, where towering temples pierce the jungle canopy. Capture the energy of vibrant markets overflowing with handcrafted textiles and fresh produce. Antigua, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, offers charming cobblestone streets, pastel-painted colonial buildings, and majestic volcanoes as a backdrop.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Beyond the scenery, Guatemala’s heart lies in its people. Photograph the smiles of indigenous communities dressed in traditional clothing (though you’ll need to be respectful and ask permission first, as many local people don’t like having their picture taken).</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>While you may be worried about safety in Guatemala, as long as you take sensible precautions, you should be fine. I spent 3 months exploring this amazing country with my camera, and came back with some of the best photos of my life.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>2.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>EYE-CATCHING STREET PHOTOGRAPHY IN CUBA</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>If street photography is more your thing, then look no further than Cuba. Neglected by the Castro regime and battered by the US embargo that prevented any modernisation, Cuba has been effectively locked in a time warp for decades. But while this has been terrible for the country and its people in many ways, there’s no denying that it has made Cuba a dream destination for travel photographers.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Wander the Cuban city streets in Havana and Trinidad and you’ll be spoilt for photography choice, with colourful historic buildings at every turn. Get lost down alleyways and side roads, delighting in the crumbling paintwork, the ornate wrought-iron decorations, and the brightly-painted shutters that cheerily hide the dilapidation within. Smile at the friendly Cuban people, who welcome visitors and don’t seem to mind having their photos taken.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>And then of course there are the famous Cuban cars, which roll the streets like living antiques. If you’re anything like me you can easily while away many hours photographing them from every angle, even missing dinner! Which is no great loss, because the food in Cuba is pretty terrible – but it’s a small price to pay for all the stunning photos you’ll bring home.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>3.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>THE HISTORIC RUINS OF TURKEY</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Turkey has been described as ‘the world’s largest outdoor museum’, a title well-earned thanks to the country’s fantastic architectural and historic heritage.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Turkey sits on the border between Europe and Asia, and over the centuries has been invaded by everyone from the Greeks and Romans to the Persians and Mongols. All of whom left their mark on the country in different and fascinating ways – now a gift to you and me with our cameras.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>There are dozens upon dozens of ancient ruins in Turkey, from the legendary city of Troy to the rock temples of Midas City and the extraordinary landscape of Hierapolis-Pamukkale – all of which are great places for photography.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Or you could head to the glorious city of Istanbul to photograph its stunning mosques and minarets as the sun goes down over the Bosphorus, and of course you cannot miss the world-famous ‘fairy chimneys’ of Cappadoccia.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>So if you’re looking for a place to travel for photography that features ancient history and architecture, all set in dramatic landscapes under a glorious Mediterranean sun, Turkey is the destination for you!</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>4.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>ITALY FOR… WELL… EVERYTHING!</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Oh God, where do I start with Italy?! There’s so much choice for travel photographers, from the bewildering array of Roman ruins, to the sumptuous palaces and churches of cities like Florence and Verona, to the iconic canals and bridges of Venice, to the undulating landscapes of Tuscany, to the colourful painted towns of the Amalfi Coast and Cinque Terre, you could spend a year exploring Italy with your camera and still not have seen enough!</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Italy does have a reputation for being crowded – which is hardly surprising for country that is so accessible and has so much to offer – so if you want to avoid the crowds and take travel photos that are a bit less obvious, why not head to one of the slightly less touristy, but no less beautiful, parts of the country?</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>One top pick would be Trento, in the north. A charming city nestled in the foothills of the Dolomites, Trento offers both colourful Italian city views and gorgeous mountain scenery. Or head to Naples for history and architecture but with an edgy side.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Or if pretty towns and villages are more your bag, avoid celebrity-famous Tuscany and go to Umbria instead, where places like Orvieto, Assisi and Todi offer plenty of opportunities to capture the real heart of Italy, away from the worst of the tourist madness.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>5.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>HISTORY AND COUNTRYSIDE IN PROVENCE, FRANCE</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>There are few other places in France, or indeed Europe, that offer the diversity of landscapes that you’ll find in Provence. You could spend weeks snapping the quintessential hilltop villages, grand chateaux, sprawling vineyards, rustic olive groves, and plane tree-lined boulevards.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>And that’s just the countryside. Provence is also where you’ll find the Calanques National Park, with its dramatic fjords and idyllic beaches; the Verdon Gorge, touted as being the deepest canyon in Europe; Mt Sainte-Victoire, the subject of over 60 of local artist Cézanne’s paintings; and the Colorado Provençal, so named for its ochre-toned resemblance of the US state.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Seasonally, the region shows off further, with floral displays to rival those found anywhere else in the world. Most famously, the lavender fields of Provence transform the plains of Valensole, Sault, and the Luberon into a fragrant wonderland. Visit in late June – mid July to catch them at their best, and aim for golden hour to catch the most beautiful hues. Less famous, but equally as enchanting, is the poppy season which transforms empty fields around the region into a splendour of red during the month of May. </em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>6.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>THE EMERALD ISLE: IRELAND</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Whether you have a few days or a few weeks to spend in Ireland, you will still feel you don’t have enough time to capture everything you’d like to. From breathtaking vistas and incredible geological formations, the coast alone will keep you busy.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Visit the famous Cliffs of Moher and the Giant’s Causeway, but also make sure to stop off at to lesser-known places. You will be rewarded with colourful villages, dramatic cliffs, lighthouses, and old forts.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>The inland rural areas shouldn’t be disregarded either. Ireland has the brightest green country you’ll ever find, and that green is scattered with castles and quiet pastures everywhere. Even the morning fog is a feature worth waking up early for.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>If you prefer urban photography, head to Dublin. From the different Gothic styles of St Patrick’s Cathedral and Christ Church Cathedral to the colourful Temple Bar area, it’s a wonderful city to travel for photographers.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Add to that the collection of Georgian doors, 24 bridges, and many historical buildings, and you should have your hands full for a while. Around Dublin, more castles and old Irish estates are open for visitors. Take your camera and explore those sunken gardens, old structures, and unique details.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>7.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>THE WONDER OF IRAN</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Often portrayed negatively by the media, Iran is a welcoming country rich with culture, history, and the most breathtaking mosques. It is also incredibly safe to travel to and to wander around with your camera.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Start your Iran photography trip in Shiraz, home to the mesmerizing Nasir-ol-Molk Mosque. Get there early in the morning, right when it opens, to secure the best photo spot (it can get very crowded and competitive!). Then, as you watch the sun rise, the colors of the mosque’s stained glass windows begin reflecting on the carpet, creating a rainbow light show.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>Another incredible place for architectural photography in Iran is the city of Isfahan, home to the magnificent Naqsh-e Jahan Square. This square is filled with history, and is framed by two incredibly gorgeous mosques: Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque and Shah Mosque. The intricate mosaic tiles inside these mosques are simply unbelievable, and you can easily spend hours photographing them from different angles. </em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><em>To get the best architecture shots in Iran, shoot at sunrise or very early in the morning for the best lighting and the least amount of tourists. Keep in mind that the architecture in Iran is also very majestic, so having adequate gear, such as some solid wide-angle lenses for the Sony a7III, would really help capture the scale of the mosques. Be sure to also bring some wide-aperture lenses as some of the mosques are pretty dimly lit.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p>"
