One of the earliest instances dates back to Expo 67 in Montreal, where \"Kinoautomat,\" the pioneering interactive film, was showcased. Installed in a custom cinema, this film introduced red and green buttons on each seat, enabling viewers to make plot-altering choices at key junctures. Viewers' votes determined the course of the narrative, giving birth to the concept of interactivity in cinema.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Fast forward to the 1980s, the release of \"Dragon's Lair\" marked a significant leap in interactive storytelling. Unlike traditional arcade games, this creation utilized LaserDisc technology to store extensive data, providing players with an immersive and visually engaging experience.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><strong>The Rise of Interactive Gaming and Beyond</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The 1990s witnessed further strides in interactive entertainment, driven by advancements in data storage technology.

Titles like \"The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery,\" \"Under a Killing Moon,\" \"The X-Files Game,\" \"Phantasmagoria,\" and \"Star Trek: Borg\" captured the essence of this era.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">In 2004, Telltale Games Studio, founded by ex-LucasArts employees, redefined interactive gaming. Known for their episodic game releases and incorporation of Quick Time Events (QTEs) and dialogue choices, Telltale Games paved the way for modern interactive fantasies. The legacy of their approach can still be observed in games from various developers.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><strong>From Gaming to Streaming: The Modern Interactive Movie Experience</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">As technology advanced, interactive movies found their way into the world of streaming. Streaming platforms like Netflix have embraced this format, offering viewers an array of interactive films. \"Black Mirror: Bandersnatch,\" \"You vs. Wild,\" and \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend\" have captivated audiences by integrating interactive elements seamlessly into the viewing experience.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The era of cloud gaming and streaming platforms has further democratized interactive movies.
