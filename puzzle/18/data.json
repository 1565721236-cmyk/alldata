        "<p>Ecological restoration services encompass a range of practices designed to restore ecosystems to their natural, functional states. They go beyond basic environmental protection by actively reversing damage, whether from industrial activity, agriculture, or urban expansion. Two primary areas of focus are:</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Greening maintenance</strong>: Sustaining and enhancing vegetation (trees, grasses, shrubs) to rebuild green spaces.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Soil and water conservation</strong>: Preventing erosion, improving soil health, and safeguarding water quality and quantity.</p>",
        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. Greening Maintenance: Reviving Vegetation and Green Spaces</strong></h4>",
        "<p>Greening maintenance focuses on establishing, nurturing, and preserving plant life to restore ecosystems. It is critical for urban areas, degraded lands, and post-construction sites.</p>",
        "<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Key Practices</strong></h5>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Native species planting</strong>: Using locally adapted plants (trees, flowers, grasses) that thrive in the region's climate and support local wildlife (pollinators, birds). Native species require less water and resist pests better than non-native varieties.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Regular pruning and monitoring</strong>: Trimming overgrown vegetation to promote healthy growth, removing invasive species (e.g., weeds that outcompete natives), and checking for disease or stress (e.g., drought damage).</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Irrigation management</strong>: Using efficient systems (drip irrigation, rainwater harvesting) to minimize water waste while ensuring plants receive adequate moisture—especially in arid regions.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Soil enrichment</strong>: Adding organic matter (compost, mulch) to improve soil fertility, which supports stronger root growth and reduces erosion.</p>",
        "<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Common Applications</strong></h5>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Urban greening</strong>: Transforming vacant lots, rooftops, or roadside verges into community gardens, parks, or \"green corridors\" that cool cities, reduce air pollution, and boost mental well-being.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Post-mining restoration</strong>: Replanting areas damaged by mining with deep-rooted plants to stabilize soil and prevent toxic runoff.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Reforestation</strong>: Restoring forests in deforested regions to sequester carbon, prevent landslides, and rebuild habitats.</p>",
        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Soil and Water Conservation: Protecting the Foundation of Ecosystems</strong></h4>",
        "<p>Soil and water are interconnected—healthy soil retains water, while clean water nourishes soil. Conservation practices prevent erosion, preserve soil structure, and maintain water quality.</p>",
        "<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Key Techniques</strong></h5>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Contour plowing and terracing</strong>: Plowing along the natural slope of land (contour plowing) or building stepped terraces slows water flow, reducing soil erosion in agricultural or hilly areas.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Cover cropping</strong>: Planting crops (e.g., clover, rye) during off-seasons to cover bare soil, which reduces wind and water erosion, adds organic matter, and improves soil structure.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Riparian buffers</strong>: Planting vegetation (grasses, shrubs, trees) along rivers, lakes, or streams to filter runoff, trap sediment, and prevent pollutants from entering waterways.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Check dams and permeable surfaces</strong>: Small dams (check dams) in gullies slow water flow and trap sediment; permeable pavements (in urban areas) allow rainwater to infiltrate soil instead of running off.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Soil mulching</strong>: Spreading organic mulch (wood chips, straw) over soil to retain moisture, reduce temperature extremes, and prevent erosion from wind and rain.</p>",
        "<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Benefits</strong></h5>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Reduced erosion</strong>: Conserved soil retains nutrients, supporting agriculture and natural vegetation.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Cleaner water</strong>: Filtered runoff reduces pollution in rivers and groundwater, benefiting drinking water supplies and aquatic life.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&middot; <!--[endif]--><strong>Flood prevention</strong>: Healthy soil and vegetation absorb rainwater, reducing the risk of flooding in heavy rains.</p>",
