The mountain range is composed of three parts, namely, Middle Atlas Mountain, High Atlas Mountain and Anji Atlas Mountain, with a northeast southwest trend and parallel to the coastline.</p><p>The western section of the mountain range is complex and high, consisting of four mountains, namely, Rif Mountain, Middle Atlas Mountain, Great Atlas Mountain (main vein) and Outer Atlas Mountain, with an altitude of more than 2500 meters. The highest peak, Tubkale Mountain, is 4167 meters above sea level, located in the southwest of Morocco, and is the highest peak in northern Africa. The eastern part of the mountain is gradually reduced, mainly divided into the Taylor Atlas Mountain and the Sahara Atlas Mountain. The average altitude is about 1500 meters, and the middle part is a plateau about 1000 meters above sea level.</p><p>The Atlas Mountains are the meeting point of two different air masses, the wet and cold polar air mass from the north and the dry tropical air mass from the south, resulting in a variety of climate and natural landscape of the mountains. The water system of the mountain range is mainly formed by seasonal rainfall, and the soil types include limestone, marl, and alluvial soil.</p><p>The vegetation of the Atlas Mountains is mainly oak forest, olive dwarf forest and shrub, and the main distribution area is the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. At higher altitudes, there are snow pine forests and other coniferous forests. There are also abundant mineral resources in the mountains, such as apatite and iron.</p><p>The Atlas Mountains are the settlement of the Berber people, who retain their own language, traditions and beliefs. Berber villages are usually built on mountains or valleys, using stone and soil as the main building materials.</p><p>The Atlas Mountains are rich in tourism resources, including spectacular natural landscapes such as mountains, canyons, waterfalls and forests, as well as ancient castles, mosques and traditional Berber villages. Tourists can engage in activities such as hiking, mountaineering, skiing, horseback riding, as well as taste local cuisine and unique handicrafts.</p><p>In short, the Atlas Mountains are important geographical indications and tourist attractions in northwest Africa, with rich natural and cultural resources.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 19px;\"><strong>Recommended hiking arrangements in Atlas Mountains</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: 19px;\">:</span></p><p>The mountain range runs in a northeast southwest direction, parallel to the coastline, with the highest peak being the Tobkar Peak at an altitude of 4167 meters.

You can park and enjoy the scenery or explore at any time according to your interests and itinerary. There are some relatively complete highway networks around the Atlas Mountains, and self driving can easily reach the starting points of each hiking and the surrounding scenic spots. However, the roads in some mountainous areas may be rugged and require some driving experience and skills.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Charter car: For tourists who are not familiar with the local road conditions or do not want to drive by themselves, charter car is a good choice. Chartering can provide professional drivers who are familiar with the local roads and environment, ensuring the safety and smoothness of the journey. Meanwhile, chartering a car can also provide customized itinerary arrangements based on the needs of tourists, making it more flexible and convenient.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Public transportation:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Long distance bus: In countries where the Atlas Mountains are located, such as Morocco and Algeria, there is a relatively developed long-distance bus network. You can take a long-distance bus to the main cities or towns around the mountain range, and then transfer to other transportation to reach the hiking site. The ticket price of long-distance buses is relatively cheap, suitable for tourists with limited budgets.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Trains: There are train routes to the Atlas Mountains in some areas. Train travel allows you to enjoy the scenery along the way and is relatively comfortable. However, the train stations may be limited and may not be able to directly reach the starting point of the hike. It is necessary to combine other modes of transportation for transfer.</span></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 19px;\"><strong>Recommended travel time:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Spring (March May):</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The climate is suitable, the temperature is moderate, neither too cold in winter nor as hot as in summer. At this time, the vegetation in the mountains is beginning to recover, and wildflowers are gradually blooming.
