Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances to block these specific targets:</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Blocking Signals</strong>: Some targeted drugs interfere with signals that tell cancer cells to divide. For example, certain breast cancers have too much of a protein called HER2, which promotes cell growth. Drugs like trastuzumab block HER2, slowing or stopping tumor growth.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Preventing Angiogenesis</strong>: Cancer cells need new blood vessels to get nutrients. Anti-angiogenic drugs (e.g., bevacizumab) stop the formation of these blood vessels, \"starving\" the tumor.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Boosting the Immune System</strong>: Some targeted therapies help the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. For instance, immune checkpoint inhibitors release the \"brakes\" on immune cells, allowing them to fight cancer more effectively.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Delivering Toxins</strong>: Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are antibodies that attach to cancer cells, delivering toxic substances directly to them, minimizing damage to healthy cells.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Cancers Treated with Targeted Therapy </strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Targeted therapy is used for many types of cancer, including:</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Breast Cancer</strong>: Drugs targeting HER2 or hormone receptors (e.g., tamoxifen for estrogen receptor-positive tumors).</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Lung Cancer</strong>: Treatments for mutations like EGFR, ALK, or ROS1, which are common in non-small cell lung cancer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Colorectal Cancer</strong>: Drugs targeting VEGF or EGFR to slow tumor growth.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Leukemia and Lymphoma</strong>: Targeted therapies for specific genetic mutations (e.g., imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia with the BCR-ABL mutation).</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Melanoma</strong>: Drugs targeting BRAF mutations, which drive growth in many melanomas.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The availability depends on the cancer’s specific genetic or molecular features, identified through tests like genetic sequencing.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What to Expect During Treatment </strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Testing First</strong>: Before starting, doctors perform biomarker tests (e.g., blood tests or tissue biopsies) to check if the cancer has targets that can be treated. This ensures the therapy is likely to work.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Administration</strong>: Targeted drugs may be taken orally (pills), intravenously (IV), or applied topically (creams for skin cancers). The frequency depends on the drug—some are daily, others weekly or monthly.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Doctors track progress with imaging scans (CT, MRI) and blood tests. They check for side effects and may adjust the dose if needed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Duration</strong>: Treatment continues as long as it works and side effects are manageable.

If it does, targeted therapy may be an option. Results from these tests guide treatment decisions.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Q: What are the most common side effects?</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A: Side effects vary by drug but may include skin issues (rashes, dryness), digestive problems (diarrhea, nausea), fatigue, or high blood pressure. Most are manageable with medications or dose adjustments.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Q: Can targeted therapy cure cancer?</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A: It can lead to long-term remission for some cancers, but \"cure\" depends on factors like cancer type, stage, and response to treatment. For advanced cancers, it may control growth and extend life rather than cure.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Q: Is targeted therapy more expensive than chemotherapy?</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A: Yes, targeted drugs are often more costly due to their complex development. However, many insurance plans cover them, and patient assistance programs may help with costs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Q: Can I stop treatment if side effects are bothersome?</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A: Never stop without consulting your doctor. They may adjust the dose, prescribe medications for side effects, or switch to another therapy. Stopping abruptly could allow cancer to grow.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Conclusion </strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Targeted therapy offers a personalized approach to cancer treatment, focusing on the unique features of each patient’s tumor. While it’s not suitable for all cancers, it has improved outcomes for many, with fewer severe side effects than traditional treatments. If you’re considering targeted therapy, talk to your doctor about biomarker testing and what to expect—understanding your options is key to making informed decisions about your care.</span></p>"
