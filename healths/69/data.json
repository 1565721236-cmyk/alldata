Know Your Measurements </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Before purchasing any light fixture online, measure the space where it will be installed. For ceiling - mounted lights, consider the ceiling height and the size of the room. For table or floor lamps, measure the available surface area or the height needed to fit the space. This ensures that the lighting fixture you choose will not only look good but also function properly.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Check Product Reviews </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">One of the advantages of online shopping is the availability of customer reviews.

Look at Return Policies </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Since you can't physically see and touch the product before buying, it's important to understand the online retailer's return policy.
