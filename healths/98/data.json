    "<p style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><img src=\"public/images/98_content_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\"></span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 2;\"> </p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How Ultrasonic Teeth Cleaning Works </strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Ultrasonic cleaners use a handpiece that emits high-frequency vibrations (typically 20,000–45,000 Hz). These vibrations create tiny bubbles in a stream of water or antimicrobial solution, which dislodge and break down plaque and tartar from the teeth and gums. The water also flushes away the debris, leaving the teeth clean. Unlike traditional scraping with metal tools, ultrasonic cleaning is gentler on the gums and more efficient at reaching hard-to-reach areas, like between teeth and under the gumline.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Whitening Effects of Ultrasonic Cleaning </strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Stain Removal</strong>: The primary whitening effect comes from removing surface stains caused by coffee, tea, tobacco, or food. These stains sit on the enamel and are lifted during the cleaning, making the teeth appear brighter immediately.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Not a Bleaching Method</strong>: Unlike professional whitening treatments (which use hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide to lighten the enamel), ultrasonic cleaning doesn’t change the natural color of the teeth. It restores the teeth’s original shade by eliminating external discoloration.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Results</strong>: Most people notice a 1–2 shade improvement in brightness after a single session, especially if they have significant surface stains. For more dramatic whitening, ultrasonic cleaning is often combined with bleaching treatments.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>The Procedure: What to Expect </strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Pre-Cleaning Exam</strong>: The dentist or hygienist will first examine your teeth and gums to check for cavities, gum disease, or other issues that might affect the procedure.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Ultrasonic Cleaning</strong>: The handpiece is gently moved over the teeth. You may feel vibrations and hear a high-pitched sound, but most patients find it comfortable—less irritating than traditional scraping. The water spray keeps the area cool and washes away debris.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Polishing</strong>: After removing tartar and stains, the teeth are polished with a special paste (often flavored) to smooth the enamel, reducing future plaque buildup and enhancing shine.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Duration</strong>: A typical session takes 30–60 minutes, depending on the amount of plaque and tartar.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Benefits Beyond Whitening </strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Gum Health</strong>: By removing plaque and tartar, ultrasonic cleaning reduces the risk of gingivitis (gum inflammation) and periodontal disease, which can lead to tooth loss if untreated.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Efficiency</strong>: It cleans more thoroughly than brushing alone, reaching areas where toothbrushes and floss miss.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Comfort</strong>: The gentle vibrations are less likely to cause sensitivity compared to manual scaling, making it a good option for people with sensitive teeth or gums.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Who Can Benefit from Ultrasonic Cleaning? </strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Anyone with Plaque or Tartar Buildup</strong>: Regular cleanings (every 6 months) help maintain oral health and prevent stains from setting in.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Those with Surface Stains</strong>: If your teeth are discolored from lifestyle habits (like drinking coffee), ultrasonic cleaning can refresh their appearance.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>People with Sensitive Gums</strong>: The gentler approach is less likely to cause bleeding or discomfort compared to traditional scaling.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">However, it may not be suitable for people with certain conditions, such as pacemakers (due to the vibrations) or severe gum disease (which may require deeper cleaning first). Your dentist will advise if it’s right for you.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How to Maintain Whitening Results </strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Oral Hygiene</strong>: Brush twice daily with a whitening toothpaste, floss daily, and use mouthwash to prevent new stains.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Limit Staining Foods/Drinks</strong>: Reduce consumption of coffee, tea, red wine, and tobacco, or rinse your mouth with water after consuming them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Regular Cleanings</strong>: Schedule ultrasonic cleanings every 6 months to keep stains at bay and maintain brightness.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>FAQs </strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Q: Does ultrasonic teeth cleaning hurt?</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A: Most patients report little to no pain. You may feel slight pressure or vibrations, but it’s generally more comfortable than traditional scraping. Those with very sensitive teeth might feel mild discomfort, which can be managed with numbing gel if needed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Q: How long do the whitening effects last?</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A: Surface stain removal lasts 3–6 months, depending on your habits. Avoiding staining substances and maintaining good oral hygiene extends the results.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Q: Can ultrasonic cleaning whiten teeth with intrinsic stains?</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A: No. Intrinsic stains (inside the enamel, caused by medications or trauma) require bleaching or other whitening treatments. Ultrasonic cleaning only addresses external stains.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Q: Is it safe for children?</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A: Yes, it’s safe for kids and can help teach good oral care habits. Dentists often recommend it for children with tartar buildup or difficulty brushing properly.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Ultrasonic teeth cleaning is an effective way to refresh your smile by removing stains and promoting oral health. While it’s not a substitute for bleaching, it’s a great first step in achieving a brighter, healthier-looking mouth. Consult your dentist to see if it’s part of your personalized dental care plan.</span></p>"
