  "section": "What Are Medications?\nMedications (or drugs) are substances designed to prevent, treat, or manage diseases, alleviate symptoms, or improve bodily functions. They can be derived from natural sources (e.g., plants, minerals) or synthesized chemically in laboratories. Medications work by interacting with the body’s biological systems—for example, by blocking pain signals, fighting infections, or regulating hormone levels. They come in various forms, including pills, capsules, liquids, injections, creams, and inhalers, and are classified based on their purpose, ingredients, and how they are regulated.",

Examples include antibiotics for severe infections, opioids for chronic pain, and medications for chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension. They are often stronger or have more significant side effects, requiring professional oversight.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Over-the-Counter (OTC) Medications</strong>: Available without a prescription, these treat mild, common conditions such as headaches, colds, or minor pain. Examples include pain relievers (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen), antihistamines for allergies, and cough suppressants. They are considered safe for general use when following label instructions.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Generic vs. Brand-Name Medications</strong>: Generic drugs contain the same active ingredients as brand-name versions but are typically cheaper. They meet the same quality and effectiveness standards as brand-name drugs, as regulated by health authorities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Specialty Medications</strong>: These are complex drugs used to treat serious or rare conditions, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, or multiple sclerosis. They may be biologic (made from living organisms) and often require special storage, administration (e.g., injections), or monitoring.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Herbal and Dietary Supplements</strong>: While not always classified as medications, these products (e.g., vitamins, herbal extracts) are used to support health. They are regulated differently than pharmaceuticals and may interact with other drugs, so consulting a healthcare provider is advisable.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How Medications Work</strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Medications interact with the body’s cells, tissues, or organs to produce a therapeutic effect:</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Targeting Specific Receptors</strong>: Many drugs bind to proteins (receptors) on cell surfaces, triggering or blocking biological responses. For example, beta-blockers attach to heart receptors to lower blood pressure.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Altering Enzyme Activity</strong>: Some medications inhibit or enhance enzymes (proteins that speed up chemical reactions) to regulate bodily processes. Statins, for instance, block an enzyme involved in cholesterol production.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Fighting Pathogens</strong>: Antibiotics kill or inhibit bacteria, while antiviral drugs interfere with virus replication, helping the immune system fight infections.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Replacing Deficiencies</strong>: Hormone replacement therapies (e.g., insulin for diabetes, thyroid medication) <span style=\"font-family: 等线;\">补充 </span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">the body’s insufficient production of essential substances.</span></span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Safe Medication Use Practices</strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Follow Prescriptions Exactly</strong>: Take the prescribed dose at the correct time, and complete the full course (e.g., antibiotics) even if symptoms improve. Do not skip doses or adjust amounts without consulting a healthcare provider.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Read Labels Carefully</strong>: For OTC drugs, check active ingredients, dosage instructions, and warnings (e.g., “do not take with alcohol”). Note expiration dates, as expired medications may lose effectiveness or become harmful.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Track All Medications</strong>: Keep a list of current prescriptions, OTC drugs, and supplements, including dosages and frequencies. Share this list with healthcare providers to avoid harmful interactions.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">• </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Store Properly</strong>: Keep medications in a cool, dry place (avoid bathrooms, where humidity can degrade them).
