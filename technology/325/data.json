        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Identifying Common Door Sensor Faults </strong></h4>",
        "<p>Before diving into repairs, it's essential to recognize the signs of a faulty door sensor. Here are the most typical issues users encounter:</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>No alerts when the door opens/closes</strong>: The sensor fails to send notifications or trigger connected devices (e.g., alarms, lights) when the door state changes.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>False alerts</strong>: The sensor sends notifications even when the door is closed, or triggers alarms without cause.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Intermittent functionality</strong>: Alerts work sometimes but not others, or the sensor connects and disconnects randomly.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Unresponsive to app commands</strong>: The sensor doesn't appear in the app, or settings changes (e.g., adjusting alert times) don't take effect.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Battery-related issues</strong>: The sensor dies quickly despite new batteries, or low-battery alerts are delayed or missing.</p>",
        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting and Repairs </strong></h4>",
        "<p>Most door sensor faults can be resolved with simple troubleshooting. Follow these steps for each common issue:</p>",
        "<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. No Alerts or Unresponsive Sensors </strong></h5>",
        "<p><strong>Possible causes</strong>: Dead batteries, misalignment between the sensor and magnet, connectivity issues, or a faulty sensor unit.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Fixes</strong>:</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Check batteries</strong>: Replace with fresh batteries (ensure correct polarity). If using rechargeable batteries, fully charge them. Test with a battery tester to confirm they're functional.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Realign the sensor and magnet</strong>: Over time, adhesive can loosen, causing misalignment. Ensure the sensor and magnet are within the manufacturer's recommended distance (usually 1&ndash;2 cm) when the door is closed. Clean the surfaces and reattach with new adhesive strips if needed.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Reset the sensor</strong>: Most sensors have a reset button (often tiny, requiring a paperclip to press). Hold it for 5&ndash;10 seconds to reset, then reconnect to your app/hub.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Check connectivity</strong>: For Wi-Fi/Zigbee/Z-Wave sensors, verify the hub is online and within range. Move the hub closer to the sensor if signal strength is weak (check the app for signal indicators). For Bluetooth models, ensure your phone is within range (typically 10&ndash;30 meters).</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Test with a different device</strong>: If the sensor connects to a hub, try pairing it with another compatible hub to rule out a hub-specific issue. If it still fails, the sensor may be defective and require replacement.</p>",
        "<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. False Alerts </strong></h5>",
        "<p><strong>Possible causes</strong>: Misalignment, low batteries, environmental interference, or a damaged magnet.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Fixes</strong>:</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Realign and secure</strong>: Ensure the sensor and magnet are firmly attached and aligned—even slight movement can trigger false alerts. Tighten screws (if used) or replace worn adhesive.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Replace batteries</strong>: Weak batteries can cause erratic behavior, including false triggers. Swap in new batteries and check if the issue persists.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Reduce interference</strong>: Wireless sensors can be disrupted by other electronics (e.g., microwaves, cordless phones) or metal objects. Move the sensor away from these sources, or switch to a sensor using a different frequency (e.g., Zigbee instead of Wi-Fi) if interference is chronic.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Inspect the magnet</strong>: A cracked or weakened magnet may not maintain a strong enough field. Replace the magnet with a new one (most manufacturers sell spares).</p>",
        "<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>3. Intermittent Functionality </strong></h5>",
        "<p><strong>Possible causes</strong>: Poor connectivity, fluctuating power (for wired sensors), or software glitches.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Fixes</strong>:</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Boost signal strength</strong>: For mesh networks (Zigbee/Z-Wave), add a range extender or another compatible device to strengthen the network. For Wi-Fi sensors, install a Wi-Fi extender near the sensor.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Update firmware</strong>: Check the app for sensor firmware updates. Manufacturers often release updates to fix connectivity bugs.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Check for wired issues (if applicable)</strong>: Wired sensors may have loose connections or damaged cables. Inspect the wiring for fraying, and ensure connections to the hub are secure. Replace damaged cables if needed.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Avoid extreme temperatures</strong>: Outdoor sensors exposed to extreme heat or cold may function intermittently. Ensure they're rated for your climate (look for temperature ranges in the product specs) and shield them from direct sunlight or harsh weather if possible.</p>",
        "<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>4. Battery Drain Issues </strong></h5>",
        "<p><strong>Possible causes</strong>: High alert frequency, cold weather, defective batteries, or a sensor malfunction.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Fixes</strong>:</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Adjust settings</strong>: Reduce the frequency of status updates or alerts in the app (e.g., disable \"door closed\" alerts if not needed). This lowers power usage.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Use lithium batteries</strong>: In cold environments, lithium batteries (vs. alkaline) hold charge longer. They're more expensive but ideal for outdoor sensors.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Check for stuck sensors</strong>: If the sensor's internal switch is stuck (e.g., due to dirt or debris), it may continuously draw power. Clean the sensor with compressed air, or gently tap it to free the switch.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Replace the sensor</strong>: If batteries drain within days despite these steps, the sensor likely has a hardware defect (e.g., a short circuit). Contact the manufacturer for a replacement if under warranty.</p>",
        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Tools You'll Need for Repairs </strong></h4>",
        "<p>Most door sensor repairs require minimal tools:</p>",
