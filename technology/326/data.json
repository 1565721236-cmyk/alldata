        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>How Do Smart Home Door Sensors Work? </strong></h4>",
        "<p>At their core, smart door sensors operate on a simple principle: they detect when a door (or window) changes state—from closed to open, or vice versa. Most models consist of two parts: a sensor unit and a magnet. The sensor is attached to the door frame, while the magnet is placed on the door itself, aligned with the sensor when the door is closed. When the door opens, the magnet moves away from the sensor, breaking a magnetic field or triggering a contact switch. This change is registered by the sensor, which then sends a signal to a connected hub, smartphone app, or other smart devices.</p>",
        "<p>Wireless connectivity is a key feature. Sensors typically use Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, or Z-Wave to communicate. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi models often connect directly to your phone, while Zigbee or Z-Wave sensors require a smart hub (like those from popular smart home brands) to relay signals, which can extend range and reduce battery drain.</p>",
        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Key Features to Consider </strong></h4>",
        "<p>When choosing a smart door sensor, several features can impact performance and usability:</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Real-time alerts</strong>: The most basic function—receive instant notifications on your phone when a door is opened or closed. Some sensors let you customize alerts (e.g., only for specific times, like when you're away).</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Battery life</strong>: Most sensors run on replaceable or rechargeable batteries. Look for models with long battery life (6&ndash;24 months) to avoid frequent replacements. Low-battery alerts are a useful feature to prevent downtime.</p>",
