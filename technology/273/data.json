When the equipment is in operation, the rotor rotates at high speed, causing the biological samples placed in the rotor to be subjected to a strong centrifugal force. Due to differences in density, size, etc. among different components in the sample, they will settle at different speeds under the influence of centrifugal force, thereby achieving separation. For example, when processing blood samples, red blood cells, white blood cells, and plasma will be stratified due to different densities, facilitating subsequent extraction and analysis.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Applicable Fields </strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">1.&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]-->Pharmaceutical Industry: In the process of drug research and development and production, biological processing centrifuges can be used to separate and purify biological products such as antibiotics and vaccines, ensuring the purity and quality of drugs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">2.&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]-->Bioengineering: It is often used in links such as cell collection after cell culture and protein purification, providing pure biological materials for bioengineering research.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">3.&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]-->Medical Field: It can separate and detect biological samples such as blood and urine, assisting in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Operational Points </strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">1.&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]-->Sample Loading: Biological samples need to be evenly loaded into centrifuge tubes, and the weight of the centrifuge tubes must be balanced to avoid abnormal operation of the equipment or damage to samples due to imbalance.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">2.&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]-->Parameter Setting: Reasonably set parameters such as centrifugal speed, time, and temperature according to the characteristics of the sample and separation requirements.
