Here's what you need to do:</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]--><strong>Check the sensor package</strong>: Unbox the door sensor and confirm all components are included. Typically, a door sensor set contains a sensor unit, a magnet, batteries, adhesive strips, screws (for optional mounting), and an instruction manual. Read the manual carefully as different brands may have specific requirements.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]--><strong>Choose the right location</strong>: Select where to install the sensor. For a door, the ideal position is on the door frame and the corresponding part of the door. Ensure the sensor and magnet can align when the door is closed (the distance between them should be within the manufacturer's recommended range, usually 1 - 2 cm). For windows, the same principle applies&mdash;mount the sensor on the window frame and the magnet on the sash.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]--><strong>Gather necessary tools</strong>: Most door sensors can be installed with just a few tools. These include a clean cloth (to wipe the installation surface), a pencil (to mark positions), a screwdriver (if using screws for mounting), and possibly a level (to ensure the sensor and magnet are aligned straight).</span></p>\n<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Step - by - Step Installation Process </strong></span></h4>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Follow these steps to install your door sensor correctly:</span></p>\n<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>1. Clean the installation surface </strong></span></h5>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Use a clean cloth to wipe the areas where the sensor and magnet will be mounted. Remove any dust, dirt, or grease, as this can affect the adhesion of the adhesive strips. For better adhesion, you can also wipe the surface with a small amount of rubbing alcohol and let it dry completely.</span></p>\n<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>2. Determine the mounting positions </strong></span></h5>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Hold the sensor against the door frame (or window frame) and the magnet against the door (or window sash). Close the door/window to check if they align properly. The sensor and magnet should be as close as possible without touching. Mark the positions lightly with a pencil.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><em>Tip</em>: For sliding doors or windows, mount the sensor and magnet on the overlapping edges to ensure alignment when closed.</span></p>\n<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>3. Mount the sensor and magnet </strong></span></h5>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">There are two common mounting methods: using adhesive strips or screws.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]--><strong>Adhesive mounting (recommended for renters)</strong>: Peel off the backing of the adhesive strips and attach one to the back of the sensor and another to the back of the magnet. Press them firmly onto the marked positions on the frame and door/window. Hold each in place for 30 - 60 seconds to ensure a strong bond. Avoid opening or closing the door/window for at least an hour to allow the adhesive to set.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]--><strong>Screw mounting (for permanent installation)</strong>: If you prefer a more secure mount, especially for outdoor doors or in areas with high humidity, use the provided screws. Drill small pilot holes at the marked positions (to prevent the frame from splitting), then attach the sensor and magnet with the screws.</span></p>\n<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>4. Insert batteries </strong></span></h5>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Open the battery compartment of the sensor (usually located on the back or side) using a screwdriver if necessary. Insert the batteries according to the polarity markings inside the compartment. Close the compartment securely. Some sensors will emit a beep or light up to indicate that the batteries are installed correctly.</span></p>\n<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>5. Test the sensor </strong></span></h5>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Close the door/window and check if the sensor recognizes the closed state. Open the door/window&mdash;most sensors will send a test alert or flash a light to confirm they're working. If there's no response, double - check the alignment of the sensor and magnet, the battery installation, and the distance between them.</span></p>\n<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>6. Connect to the smart system (for smart door sensors) </strong></span></h5>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">If you have a smart door sensor, follow these steps to connect it to your smart home system:</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]-->Download the corresponding app on your smartphone and create an account if needed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]-->Put the sensor into pairing mode. This is usually done by pressing and holding the reset button for a few seconds until the indicator light flashes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]-->In the app, follow the instructions to add a new device. Select the door sensor model and follow the on - screen prompts to complete the connection (this may involve connecting to Wi - Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, or Z - Wave depending on the sensor type).</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]-->Once connected, test the alerts through the app. Open and close the door/window to see if notifications are received promptly.</span></p>\n<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Installation Tips for Different Types of Doors and Windows </strong></span></h4>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]--><strong>Wooden doors/windows</strong>: Adhesive strips work well here, but if the wood is rough, sand it lightly first to create a smooth surface. Screw mounting is also a good option as wood is easy to drill into.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]--><strong>Metal doors/windows</strong>: Adhesive may not stick as well to metal, especially in cold weather. Screw mounting is more reliable. Alternatively, use metal - specific adhesive strips for better adhesion.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]--><strong>Glass doors/windows</strong>: For glass surfaces, use adhesive strips designed for glass. Avoid drilling into glass unless you have the proper tools and experience.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]--><strong>Outdoor doors (e.g., garage doors)</strong>: Choose weather - resistant sensors. Use screws for mounting to withstand wind and rain. Ensure the sensor and magnet are protected from direct exposure to water.</span></p>\n<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Common Installation Mistakes to Avoid </strong></span></h4>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]--><strong>Poor alignment</strong>: If the sensor and magnet are not aligned when the door is closed, the sensor won't work properly. Always check alignment before finalizing the mount.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]--><strong>Incorrect distance</strong>: Keeping the sensor and magnet too far apart (beyond the recommended range) will cause the sensor to fail to detect the door state. Too close, and they may rub against each other when the door is opened/closed, damaging the devices.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]--><strong>Mounting on moving parts</strong>: Don't mount the sensor on a part of the door that moves excessively (e.g., a loose hinge area) as this can misalign the sensor and magnet over time.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]--><strong>Ignoring surface conditions</strong>: Installing the sensor on a dirty, wet, or uneven surface will reduce the effectiveness of the adhesive. Always clean and dry the surface first.</span></p>\n<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Post - Installation Checks </strong></span></h4>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">After installation, perform these checks to ensure long - term functionality:</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]-->Open and close the door/window multiple times to confirm the sensor consistently detects the state changes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]-->Check the app (for smart sensors) to ensure alerts are sent in real - time.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]-->Inspect the mounting to make sure the sensor and magnet are secure.
