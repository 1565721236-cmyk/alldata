A computer motherboard, for example, is a small circuit board that consists of dozens and dozens of individual components: resisters, transistors, wires, connectors, CPU sockets, battery connectors, and power connectors, just to mention a few.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">All of these tiny parts need to be fixed to the board and connected in order for the computer to function. Many large manufacturers outsource things like circuit boards to companies in China and India. However, these pre-assembled components still need to be put together manually.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">With new technological advancements requiring smaller and smaller micro electronics, mass production technology has become more automated. Changes in technology have transformed the way electronic equipment is made, and modern manufacturing systems use robots, programmable motion-control devices, sensing technologies, and computers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Electronic assemblers most often work as part of an assembly line or production facility. They assemble and fabricate electronic products, meeting very precise specifications. Many different tools are used in the process, from hand-operated tools such as soldering guns and small power tools, to large automatic and semi-automatic machines.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The work ranges from fairly basic and easy assembly to complicated tasks that require advanced knowledge and experience. Assemblers often work with the designers and engineers in product development, sometimes assisting with prototypes and building test products. For more complicated tasks, being able to read and comprehend detailed blueprints and schematics is necessary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Operate Machinery</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Electronic assemblers operate design machinery and modify machinery settings as needed to meet design specifications. They also operate power tools and other heavy machinery while following strict safety guidelines. They will assemble various parts and products based on physical and digital designs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Soldering Knowledge</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Parts of the job involve manually placing and soldering resistors, diodes, capacitors, transistors, wires, and integrated circuits onto printed circuit boards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Quality Control</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Quality checks are conducted to identify faulty components and replace them at the source. Problems need to be fixed as early as possible in the stream, before large-scale manufacturing of defective products can occur.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Communication Skills</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Electronic assemblers collaborate with team members to ensure proper delineation of production roles. Communicate with engineers and design staff to ensure consistency and troubleshoot any issues with designs or production.</span></p>"
