Firstly, the liquid material to be dried is converted into fine droplets through a specialized atomization device, which is like a heavenly maiden scattering flowers, evenly dispersing the liquid. There are various atomization methods, including pressure atomization, which uses a high-pressure pump to rapidly pass the liquid through a narrow nozzle under pressure, instantly breaking it into tiny droplets; There is also centrifugal atomization, which uses a high-speed rotating disk to cause the liquid to fly out under the pulling force of centrifugal force, forming a mist; Airflow atomization relies on the impact and shear of high-speed airflow on the liquid to achieve atomization effect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">These tiny droplets immediately enter the drying tower and meet the hot air. The hot air is like an enthusiastic dancer, quickly embracing the droplets and transferring heat to them through thermal conduction, convection, and radiation, causing the moisture inside to evaporate and vaporize rapidly. In a very short period of time, the droplets undergo a phase transition from liquid to dry powder like material, completing the drying process like magic. Finally, the dried powder settles to the bottom of the drying tower and is collected under the influence of airflow or its own gravity, ready to embark on their subsequent application journey.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">2、 Types and characteristics of mainstream spray dryers</span></strong></p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">（1） Laboratory small spray dryer</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Specially tailored for research institutions, university laboratories, and small business R&amp;D departments.
