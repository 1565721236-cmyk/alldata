        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Q: Can I build a DIY wheelchair ramp at home?</strong></p>",
        "<p>A: Simple portable ramps (e.g., for curbs) can be DIY, but permanent home ramps require knowledge of slope ratios and building codes. Improperly built ramps risk injury—consult a professional.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Q: What's the maximum height a wheelchair ramp can handle?</strong></p>",
        "<p>A: For safety, ramps longer than 30 feet should include landings every 30 feet to allow rest. Steeper slopes (1:10) are sometimes used for very short rises (e.g., 2&ndash;3 inches) but are less ideal for manual wheelchairs.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Q: Are portable ramps safe for outdoor use?</strong></p>",
        "<p>A: Yes, if they have non-slip surfaces and are secured properly. Choose weather-resistant materials (aluminum) for durability in rain or snow.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Q: How do I choose the right length for a home ramp?</strong></p>",
        "<p>A: Measure the total rise (height from ground to the elevated surface). Multiply by 12 to get the minimum length (e.g., a 24-inch rise needs a 24-foot ramp for a 1:12 slope).</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Q: Do wheelchair ramps require permits?</strong></p>",
        "<p>A: Permanent home ramps often require permits to ensure compliance with local accessibility codes. Check with your local building department before installation.</p>",
        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Choosing the Right Wheelchair Ramp</strong></h4>",
        "<p>The ideal wheelchair ramp depends on your needs:</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Daily home use</strong>: A permanent, custom-built ramp (steel or wood) with handrails.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Travel or occasional use</strong>: A lightweight, foldable aluminum ramp.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Public or commercial spaces</strong>: A code-compliant disability access ramp with safety features.</p>",
        "<p>By prioritizing safety, proper sizing, and durable materials, you can select a ramp that enhances mobility and independence for yourself or others.</p>",
        "<p>Wheelchair ramps are vital for creating inclusive environments, whether at home, work, or in public spaces. With the right type—whether portable, metal, or custom-built for home use—they empower individuals with mobility challenges to move freely and safely. By understanding the options, features, and buying considerations, you can find a ramp that meets both practical needs and safety standards.</p>"
