        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>What Qualifies as a \"Small Pool\"?</strong></h4>",
        "<p>Small pools typically measure 3&ndash;7 meters (10&ndash;23 feet) in length and 2&ndash;4 meters (6&ndash;13 feet) in width, with depths ranging from 0.9&ndash;1.5 meters (3&ndash;5 feet). They are designed to maximize limited space, whether in a backyard, courtyard, or even indoors. Unlike full-sized pools, they prioritize functionality over laps, focusing on relaxation, cooling off, or casual swimming.</p>",

        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>FAQs About Small Pools</strong></h4>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Q: How long does it take to install a small fiberglass pool?</strong></p>",
        "<p>A: In-ground backyard models take 1&ndash;2 weeks (delivery, excavation, placement, and finishing). Indoor fiberglass pools may take 4&ndash;6 weeks due to indoor preparation.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Q: Can a small pool be heated?</strong></p>",
        "<p>A: Yes—solar heaters (cost-effective for warm climates) or electric heat pumps (better for cold regions) work well. Heating a small pool costs 50&ndash;150/month in winter.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Q: Are small pools suitable for cold climates?</strong></p>",
        "<p>A: Outdoor models can be winterized (drained or covered with a thermal blanket). Indoor pools are ideal for cold regions, as they're protected from snow and ice.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Q: How much water does a small pool use?</strong></p>",
        "<p>A: 10&ndash;30 cubic meters (2,600&ndash;7,900 gallons), depending on size. Refilling annually (due to evaporation) adds to water costs.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Q: Can I DIY install a small pool?</strong></p>",
        "<p>A: Above-ground vinyl or inflatable pools are DIY-friendly. In-ground pools (fiberglass, concrete) require professionals for excavation and structural work.</p>",
        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Is a Small Pool Right for You?</strong></h4>",
        "<p>Small pools are perfect if you:</p>",

        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]-->Prioritize relaxation or casual use over laps.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]-->Prefer lower maintenance and installation time (especially with fiberglass).</p>",
        "<p>They may not be ideal if you want to swim laps or host large pool parties, as their size limits these activities.</p>",
        "<p>Small pools prove that you don't need a sprawling yard to enjoy the benefits of a pool. Whether you opt for a backyard fiberglass model, a stylish courtyard design, or an indoor year-round retreat, these compact pools offer a practical, enjoyable way to cool off and relax. By considering your space, budget, and needs, you can find a small pool that transforms your home into a personal oasis.</p>"
