        "<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><img src=\"115_content_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\"></p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>I. Characteristics of Polycarbonate Sheets </strong></h2>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. High Transparency </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Polycarbonate sheets can achieve a light transmittance of around 89%, almost comparable to glass, yet they weigh only half as much. This makes them the perfect choice for greenhouses and daylighting roofs. In the daylighting design of some large commercial buildings, polycarbonate sheets can evenly introduce natural light indoors, creating a bright and comfortable space atmosphere while reducing the load on the building structure.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Lightweight and High-Strength </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Despite their light weight, polycarbonate sheets have astonishing strength. Their impact resistance is 250 - 300 times that of ordinary glass and 30 times that of tempered glass. They can easily withstand extreme weather conditions such as strong winds, heavy snow, and hailstorms. For example, in outdoor billboards and exterior wall decorations of buildings, polycarbonate sheets can remain stable and are not easily damaged even in harsh environments, thanks to their high strength.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>3. Excellent Weather Resistance </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Polycarbonate sheets treated with anti-ultraviolet (UV) protection can effectively block solar radiation, resist aging, and maintain their performance and appearance for a long time, making them especially suitable for outdoor use. In construction projects in some coastal cities, polycarbonate sheets can still remain in good condition even after years of exposure to sea breezes and sunlight.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>4. Easy Processability </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Polycarbonate sheets can be cold-bent on-site and can be processed into the required size and shape through cutting, sawing, drilling, etc., showing strong adaptability. In some personalized architectural designs, designers can process polycarbonate sheets into various unique shapes according to project requirements, bringing creative designs to life.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>5. Good Thermal Insulation </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">With a low thermal conductivity, polycarbonate sheets have excellent thermal insulation performance, making them an ideal material for energy-efficient buildings. In buildings in cold regions, using polycarbonate sheets as exterior wall or door and window materials can effectively reduce indoor heat loss and lower energy consumption.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>6. Flame Retardancy </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Polycarbonate sheets themselves have certain flame retardancy, reaching the B1 level, which can effectively delay the spread of fire. In some public buildings and industrial plants with high fire protection requirements, the flame retardant performance of polycarbonate sheets provides a strong guarantee for fire safety.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>7. Good Sound Absorption Performance </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Polycarbonate sheets also have a certain sound absorption effect, which can reduce noise interference. They are widely used in the construction of sound insulation facilities, such as highway noise barriers and places with high requirements for acoustic environments, like recording studios and schools.</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\">&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>II. Application Areas of Polycarbonate Sheets </strong></h2>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. Construction Field </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">In the construction industry, polycarbonate sheets are extremely versatile. They can be used to build greenhouses, providing an excellent lighting and thermal insulation environment for crops. In commercial buildings, they are often used as daylighting roofs, curtain walls, and partition materials, endowing buildings with a unique appearance and good functionality. In residential buildings, polycarbonate sheets can also be used for the construction of balconies, canopies, etc., enhancing the aesthetics and practicality of the residence.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Industrial Field </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">In the construction of industrial plants, polycarbonate sheets can be used as roofing and wall materials. Their high strength and weather resistance can meet the requirements of industrial environments. At the same time, in industries such as electronics, electrical appliances, and machinery manufacturing, polycarbonate sheets can also be used to make equipment protective covers, instrument panel panels, etc., serving both protective and decorative functions.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>3. Transportation Field </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">In transportation facilities, polycarbonate sheets can be used to make highway noise barriers, railway noise barriers, etc., effectively reducing the impact of traffic noise on the surrounding environment. In addition, in the automotive manufacturing and aerospace industries, polycarbonate sheets are also used in the manufacture of components such as car windows and lamp covers due to their lightweight and high-strength properties.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>4. Advertising Field </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Thanks to their high transparency and good processability, polycarbonate sheets have become a popular material in the advertising industry. They can be used to make various billboards, light boxes, etc., presenting clear and bright advertising effects to attract people's attention.</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\">&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>III.
