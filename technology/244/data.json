Segment your email list to send relevant content, and avoid sending too frequently, which can lead to unsubscribes. Also, ensure emails are mobile-friendly, as many people open them on phones.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull;&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]--><strong>Q: What role does storytelling play in digital marketing?</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A: Storytelling helps brands connect emotionally with audiences.
