Look for models that can handle different types of debris, from small dirt particles to larger leaves and twigs. A good robotic cleaner should be able to scrub the pool floor, walls, and even the waterline, ensuring a thorough clean. Some cleaners come with multiple brushes and powerful suction to tackle tough grime and algae.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Coverage Area and Navigation </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Consider the size of your pool when choosing a robotic cleaner. Larger pools may require a model with a wider coverage area and advanced navigation capabilities. Some robots use sophisticated algorithms and sensors to map the pool and ensure complete coverage without missing spots. Others may have random - navigation patterns, which can still be effective but might take a bit longer to clean the entire pool.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Filtration System </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">A quality filtration system is crucial for trapping debris and keeping the water clean. Robotic pool cleaners typically have built - in filters, either in the form of reusable filter bags or cartridges. Reusable filters are more cost - effective in the long run as you don't need to constantly replace them. Check the filter capacity and how easy it is to clean and maintain the filtration system.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Run Time and Battery Life </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">If you opt for a cordless or battery - powered robotic cleaner, pay attention to the run time. This determines how long the cleaner can operate on a single charge. For larger pools, you'll want a model with a longer run time to ensure it can complete the cleaning cycle. Corded robotic cleaners don't have this limitation but may be restricted by the length of the power cord.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Mobility and Maneuverability </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">The ability of the robotic cleaner to move around the pool smoothly is essential. Look for features like adjustable wheels, tracks, or crawler - like designs that allow the cleaner to climb walls and navigate corners easily. Some models are even designed to handle different pool shapes and surfaces, such as vinyl, fiberglass, or concrete.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Ease of Use and Maintenance </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">A user - friendly robotic pool cleaner should be easy to set up, operate, and maintain. This includes features like one - touch controls, simple programming options, and easy - to - access filter compartments. Some cleaners come with remote controls or smartphone apps, allowing you to start, stop, and customize the cleaning process from anywhere.</p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Top Picks for the Best Robotic Pool Cleaners </strong></h2>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">The Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus is a popular choice among pool owners.
