        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->◦ <!--[endif]--><strong>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</strong>: Tracks respiratory rate and oxygen levels, alerting users to worsening symptoms before they require emergency care.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->◦ <!--[endif]--><strong>Diabetes</strong>: While not measuring blood sugar directly, it detects stress hormones and hydration levels linked to glycemic control, helping users adjust insulin or diet.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Post-hospitalization care</strong>:</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->◦ <!--[endif]-->Patients recovering from heart attacks or surgeries can be monitored remotely, reducing readmission rates. The device detects signs of complications (e.g., infection-induced fever, irregular heart rhythm) early.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Preventive health</strong>:</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->◦ <!--[endif]-->Identifies early warning signs in otherwise healthy individuals (e.g., subtle changes in heart rate variability that precede hypertension).</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->◦ <!--[endif]-->Helps athletes optimize training by monitoring stress levels and recovery, reducing overexertion risks.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Elderly care</strong>:</p>",

        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>How often does the AI algorithm need updates?</strong> Over-the-air updates improve accuracy as more data is collected, ensuring it adapts to new health patterns.</p>",
        "<p>The world's first wearable AI medical device represents a leap forward in personalized, preventive healthcare. By combining clinical-grade sensors with AI analysis, it transforms intermittent health checks into continuous, actionable insights—empowering users and doctors to detect issues earlier, manage chronic conditions more effectively, and reduce healthcare costs. As technology advances, future iterations may add more sensors (e.g., blood pressure, glucose) to further expand its capabilities. For patients and providers alike, this device is a glimpse into a future where healthcare is proactive, not just reactive.</p>"
