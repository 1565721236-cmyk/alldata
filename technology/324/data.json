        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Pre - Installation Preparation </strong></h4>",
        "<p>Before starting the installation, proper preparation is key to avoid mistakes. Here's what you need to do:</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Check the sensor package</strong>: Unbox the door sensor and confirm all components are included. Typically, a door sensor set contains a sensor unit, a magnet, batteries, adhesive strips, screws (for optional mounting), and an instruction manual. Read the manual carefully as different brands may have specific requirements.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Choose the right location</strong>: Select where to install the sensor. For a door, the ideal position is on the door frame and the corresponding part of the door. Ensure the sensor and magnet can align when the door is closed (the distance between them should be within the manufacturer's recommended range, usually 1 - 2 cm). For windows, the same principle applies—mount the sensor on the window frame and the magnet on the sash.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Gather necessary tools</strong>: Most door sensors can be installed with just a few tools. These include a clean cloth (to wipe the installation surface), a pencil (to mark positions), a screwdriver (if using screws for mounting), and possibly a level (to ensure the sensor and magnet are aligned straight).</p>",
        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Step - by - Step Installation Process </strong></h4>",
        "<p>Follow these steps to install your door sensor correctly:</p>",
        "<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. Clean the installation surface </strong></h5>",
        "<p>Use a clean cloth to wipe the areas where the sensor and magnet will be mounted. Remove any dust, dirt, or grease, as this can affect the adhesion of the adhesive strips. For better adhesion, you can also wipe the surface with a small amount of rubbing alcohol and let it dry completely.</p>",
        "<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Determine the mounting positions </strong></h5>",
        "<p>Hold the sensor against the door frame (or window frame) and the magnet against the door (or window sash). Close the door/window to check if they align properly. The sensor and magnet should be as close as possible without touching. Mark the positions lightly with a pencil.</p>",
        "<p><em>Tip</em>: For sliding doors or windows, mount the sensor and magnet on the overlapping edges to ensure alignment when closed.</p>",
        "<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>3. Mount the sensor and magnet </strong></h5>",
        "<p>There are two common mounting methods: using adhesive strips or screws.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Adhesive mounting (recommended for renters)</strong>: Peel off the backing of the adhesive strips and attach one to the back of the sensor and another to the back of the magnet. Press them firmly onto the marked positions on the frame and door/window. Hold each in place for 30 - 60 seconds to ensure a strong bond. Avoid opening or closing the door/window for at least an hour to allow the adhesive to set.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Screw mounting (for permanent installation)</strong>: If you prefer a more secure mount, especially for outdoor doors or in areas with high humidity, use the provided screws. Drill small pilot holes at the marked positions (to prevent the frame from splitting), then attach the sensor and magnet with the screws.</p>",
        "<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>4. Insert batteries </strong></h5>",
        "<p>Open the battery compartment of the sensor (usually located on the back or side) using a screwdriver if necessary. Insert the batteries according to the polarity markings inside the compartment. Close the compartment securely. Some sensors will emit a beep or light up to indicate that the batteries are installed correctly.</p>",
        "<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>5. Test the sensor </strong></h5>",
        "<p>Close the door/window and check if the sensor recognizes the closed state. Open the door/window—most sensors will send a test alert or flash a light to confirm they're working. If there's no response, double - check the alignment of the sensor and magnet, the battery installation, and the distance between them.</p>",
        "<h5 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>6. Connect to the smart system (for smart door sensors) </strong></h5>",
        "<p>If you have a smart door sensor, follow these steps to connect it to your smart home system:</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]-->Download the corresponding app on your smartphone and create an account if needed.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]-->Put the sensor into pairing mode. This is usually done by pressing and holding the reset button for a few seconds until the indicator light flashes.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]-->In the app, follow the instructions to add a new device. Select the door sensor model and follow the on - screen prompts to complete the connection (this may involve connecting to Wi - Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, or Z - Wave depending on the sensor type).</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]-->Once connected, test the alerts through the app. Open and close the door/window to see if notifications are received promptly.</p>",
        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Installation Tips for Different Types of Doors and Windows </strong></h4>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Wooden doors/windows</strong>: Adhesive strips work well here, but if the wood is rough, sand it lightly first to create a smooth surface. Screw mounting is also a good option as wood is easy to drill into.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Metal doors/windows</strong>: Adhesive may not stick as well to metal, especially in cold weather. Screw mounting is more reliable. Alternatively, use metal - specific adhesive strips for better adhesion.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Glass doors/windows</strong>: For glass surfaces, use adhesive strips designed for glass. Avoid drilling into glass unless you have the proper tools and experience.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Outdoor doors (e.g., garage doors)</strong>: Choose weather - resistant sensors. Use screws for mounting to withstand wind and rain. Ensure the sensor and magnet are protected from direct exposure to water.</p>",
        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Common Installation Mistakes to Avoid </strong></h4>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Poor alignment</strong>: If the sensor and magnet are not aligned when the door is closed, the sensor won't work properly. Always check alignment before finalizing the mount.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Incorrect distance</strong>: Keeping the sensor and magnet too far apart (beyond the recommended range) will cause the sensor to fail to detect the door state. Too close, and they may rub against each other when the door is opened/closed, damaging the devices.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Mounting on moving parts</strong>: Don't mount the sensor on a part of the door that moves excessively (e.g., a loose hinge area) as this can misalign the sensor and magnet over time.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Ignoring surface conditions</strong>: Installing the sensor on a dirty, wet, or uneven surface will reduce the effectiveness of the adhesive. Always clean and dry the surface first.</p>",
        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>Post - Installation Checks </strong></h4>",
        "<p>After installation, perform these checks to ensure long - term functionality:</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]-->Open and close the door/window multiple times to confirm the sensor consistently detects the state changes.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]-->Check the app (for smart sensors) to ensure alerts are sent in real - time.</p>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]-->Inspect the mounting to make sure the sensor and magnet are secure. Tighten screws or reapply adhesive if needed.</p>",
        "<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>FAQs About Door Sensor Installation </strong></h4>",
        "<p><!-- [if !supportLists]-->&bull; <!--[endif]--><strong>Can I install a door sensor on a sliding glass door?</strong> Yes. Mount the sensor on the fixed frame and the magnet on the sliding panel, ensuring they align when the door is closed.</p>",
