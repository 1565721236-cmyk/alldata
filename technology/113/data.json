Unveiling the Working Principle </strong></h2>\n<p class=\"16\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Robotic pool cleaners are equipped with advanced built - in sensors that can accurately detect dirt on the pool bottom, walls, and waterline. Their cleaning process is comprehensive and meticulous. Equipped with multiple brushes and filters, they can effectively remove dirt and debris from the pool bottom. When cleaning the pool walls, the nozzles spray high - pressure water to eliminate attached substances. During operation, the robots rotate and move, ensuring full coverage of every corner of the pool bottom and walls to leave no cleaning blind spots. Made of lightweight materials, they avoid damaging the pool surface. They are also equipped with intelligent batteries and automatic shut - off functions, stopping work automatically when the cleaning task is completed or the battery is low. Additionally, the intelligent navigation system enables them to sense the surrounding environment and avoid obstacles, and some products even have a timer function, allowing users to set the working time according to their needs.</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\">&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>II.

Purchasing Guide </strong></h2>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. Determine Your Pool Details </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"16\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Before making a purchase, accurately measure the size and shape of your pool and understand its material (such as concrete, fiberglass, vinyl - lined, etc.). Different pool conditions require different performance and adaptability from robotic pool cleaners. For example, larger pools need cleaners with a wide cleaning range and long battery life, while irregularly shaped pools require cleaners with good steering and navigation capabilities.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Consider Cleaning Requirements </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"16\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Choose the right product according to the daily dirt level and type of debris in your pool. If there are many trees around the pool and large debris like leaves are common, select a cleaner with strong suction and a large - capacity filter basket. If the pool is prone to algae growth, choose a cleaner with targeted cleaning functions, such as strong algae - scrubbing capabilities.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>3. Compare Product Parameters </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"16\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Pay special attention to comparing parameters like suction power, the number of cleaning modes, filtration system precision, battery life, and climbing ability among different brands. Suction power determines the cleaning strength, more cleaning modes can meet various scenarios, a high - precision filtration system can purify the water quality, long battery life is suitable for large pools, and good climbing ability ensures the cleaning effect of the pool walls.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>4. Refer to User Reviews </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"16\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Check user reviews on e - commerce platforms, product forums, and other channels to understand the actual usage experience of products, including the durability of cleaning effects, ease of operation, failure rate, and quality of after - sales service. Real - user feedback can help you have a more comprehensive understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of products, avoiding the purchase of items that do not meet your expectations.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>5. Budget Planning </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"16\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">The prices of robotic pool cleaners vary widely depending on the brand, functions, and performance, ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. Set a reasonable budget before buying and screen products within that range. Consider the cost - effectiveness of the product instead of simply pursuing low or high prices, ensuring you get a high - quality product that matches your budget.</p>\n<p class=\"16\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Selecting a suitable robotic pool cleaner can make pool cleaning a breeze. By understanding brands, purchasing channels, and following the purchasing guide, you're sure to find the perfect cleaning assistant for your pool, keeping it clean and clear for endless worry - free swimming enjoyment.</p>\n<p class=\"17\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">&nbsp;</p>",
