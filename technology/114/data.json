Determine the Renovation Style </strong></h2>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. Introduction to Classic Styles </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">The modern minimalist style features clean lines, neutral tones, and functional designs, emphasizing a sense of spaciousness and practicality. It suits those who pursue a simple and comfortable lifestyle. Home products from Muji perfectly embody this style, showcasing a natural and rustic aesthetic through minimalist designs.</p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">The Scandinavian style highlights nature, comfort, and warmth. It often uses light colors, natural wood, and soft fabrics to create a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere. Many furniture and decorative items from IKEA exhibit typical Scandinavian style characteristics, boasting affordable prices and a strong sense of design.</p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">The industrial style is characterized by exposed brick walls, metal pipes, and vintage lighting fixtures, presenting a unique rugged and individual charm, which is highly favored by young and trendy individuals. Industrial - style lighting and furniture from certain brands can add a distinctive touch to home spaces.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Style Selection Methods </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">You can browse interior design websites like Houzz and Pinterest, watch home renovation shows, or visit home exhibitions. Collect pictures and cases of designs you like, analyze the elements and style features within them, and thus determine the most suitable renovation style for you and your family.</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\">&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>II. Material and Product Purchase </strong></h2>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. Selection of Renovation Materials </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">When choosing flooring materials, solid wood floors offer a great texture and comfortable foot feel but come with a higher price tag and require regular maintenance. Laminate floors are more affordable and highly durable, making them suitable for households with children and pets. For example, Pergo's laminate floors are popular among many consumers due to their excellent durability and diverse styles.</p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Regarding wall materials, latex paint is rich in color, environmentally friendly, and easy to apply. Wallpapers, on the other hand, come in a variety of patterns, creating different atmospheres. Dulux's latex paint is renowned for its long - lasting and vibrant colors as well as high environmental standards, making it a top choice for many families.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Selection of Furniture and Home Appliances </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">When purchasing furniture, consider the size of the space, style coordination, and practicality. Well - known brands like Ashley HomeStore are great options. Their furniture products cover a wide range of styles, ensure reliable quality, and are available at various price points to meet different budget requirements.</p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">When choosing home appliances, pay attention to energy efficiency ratings, functions, and after - sales services of the brands. Samsung's home appliances, for instance, excel in smart features and energy - saving capabilities, and their extensive after - sales service network provides users with a great experience.</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\">&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>III. Find a Reliable Construction Team </strong></h2>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. Screening Channels </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Recommendations from friends and neighbors can provide authentic and trustworthy information about construction teams. You can also post renovation requirements on professional renovation platforms such as HomeAdvisor and Thumbtack. These platforms will match suitable construction teams according to your needs and display their user reviews and project cases.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Key Inspection Points </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Check the construction team's qualification certificates, business licenses, and other documents to ensure their legality and professionalism. Learn about the team's construction experience and past projects. You can visit ongoing or completed projects on - site to inspect the construction techniques and quality. At the same time, clarify the team's service scope and after - sales guarantee to avoid potential disputes.</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\">&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>IV. Renovation Budget Planning </strong></h2>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. Budget Formulation </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Based on the renovation style, house area, and market prices, create a detailed budget list covering all expenses, including design fees, material costs, construction fees, and furniture and appliance purchases. You can refer to budget templates and adjust them according to the actual situation.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Cost Control </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">When purchasing materials, compare prices from different brands and suppliers to select products with high cost - effectiveness. During the construction process, plan the workflow reasonably to avoid unnecessary rework and waste. Also, set aside a certain proportion of the budget as contingency funds to cover unexpected expenses.</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\">&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>V. Renovation Process and Time Management </strong></h2>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. Main Processes </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">The general renovation process includes preliminary design, main structure demolition and modification, hydropower renovation, waterproofing work, masonry work, painting work, and installation work (such as door and window installation, cabinet installation, lighting fixture installation, and home appliance installation). Quality control is essential at each stage to ensure compliance with the design requirements.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Time Arrangement </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Arrange the renovation schedule reasonably and create a detailed construction progress plan. For example, hydropower renovation usually takes 3 - 5 days, masonry work takes 7 - 10 days, and painting work takes 5 - 7 days. Maintain close communication with the construction team, promptly address any issues that arise during construction, and ensure the renovation project is completed on time.</p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Home renovation is a systematic project. With thorough investigation, careful planning, selection of suitable materials and teams, and reasonable budget and time control, you can turn your dream home into reality. We hope this guide provides strong support for your renovation journey and helps you effortlessly achieve a satisfying home environment.</p>\n<p class=\"16\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">&nbsp;</p>",
