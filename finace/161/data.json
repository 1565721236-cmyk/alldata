Understanding these distinctions is crucial for making an informed choice that aligns with your preferences and budget.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Identifying new and used cars is not difficult, the key is to observe and examine some key features:</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">1. Mileage: New cars usually have a very low mileage, while used cars have been on the road for some time and have a relatively high mileage. Check the odometer on the dashboard to understand the vehicle's usage condition.</span></p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">2. Appearance: Upon careful examination of the exterior of the vehicle, new cars typically appear refreshed without any noticeable scratches or dents. On the contrary, used cars may have some flaws, such as minor scratches or dents.</span></p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">3. Interior: Open the car door and check the interior condition. The interior of a new car is usually clean and tidy, with no obvious wear or damage. The interior of a used car may show some degree of usage marks, such as wear, stains, or cracks.</span></p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">4. Vehicle Year: Refer to the vehicle's registration information or vehicle manual to understand the production year of the vehicle. New cars are usually newer, while used cars may be older.</span></p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">5. License plate: Observe the license plate photo. The license plates of new cars are usually relatively new and have no obvious wear or damage. The registration time on the license plate can also be used as one of the criteria for judgment.</span></p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">6. Body paint surface: Carefully inspect the body paint surface. The paint surface of a new car is usually smooth and flawless, without obvious scratches, dents, or bubbles. Second hand cars may have excessive wear or uneven paint surfaces.</span></p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">7. Wheel wear: Observe the degree of tire wear. The tires of new cars have less wear and clear tread patterns, while the degree of tire wear of used cars depends on the vehicle's usage.</span></p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">8. Component wear: Check the vehicle's components, such as brake pads, suspension system, etc. New car components usually show no obvious signs of wear, while used cars may exhibit some degree of wear.</span></p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">9. Vehicle maintenance records: Obtain maintenance and repair records of the vehicle. New cars usually have no maintenance records, while used cars have relevant historical records. These records can help you understand the usage and maintenance status of the vehicle.</span></p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Vehicle history: Try to obtain historical information about the vehicle as much as possible. Ask the car owner about the vehicle's past, including accident records, insurance claims, and repair history. New cars usually do not have these potential issues, while used cars may have some historical issues to consider.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>2.
