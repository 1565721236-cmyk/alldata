If you're not sure how to reach the recommended savings targets, use these tips that helped many of my counseling clients in the past:</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Automate it: Make sure part of each paycheck goes into your savings by setting up an automatic deposit to your savings account, even if it's just $25 per check at first.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Review your account statements: Look at your bank and credit card statements for recurring charges you can cancel and to pinpoint bad spending habits. For example, eating away from home is an often unnecessary expense, and it's gone up by 6% due to inflation in the last year.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Delete your card information: Delete your credit card information from online retail accounts, or just cancel your account subscriptions.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Work toward income growth: Working more hours means making more money, but it can also wear you out. A better strategy is setting a goal to increase your pay rate every year through a pay increase, a promotion, finding a new job, or otherwise.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Talk to a credit counselor: Schedule a free appointment with an NFCC-certified credit counselor to explore strategies and resources for improving your finances.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Go big: Cutting small expenses (like lattes) won't get you as far as cutting major expenses. Look for big charges you can eliminate temporarily or replace them with more affordable alternatives.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Ditch the new car: Most well-maintained cars are now driveable past the 200,000-mile mark. You'll save big and avoid significant depreciation losses if you stay away from buying brand-new cars.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Look for high APY: Put your savings into a high-yield savings account (HYSA) that pays you a competitive rate. Check out our ranking of the 10 best high-yield savings accounts available today.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Read more: 7 ways to save money on a tight budget</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Where should I keep my savings?</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Sure, you can keep your money under a mattress, but an FDIC- or NCUA-insured savings account is a better choice.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">When you put your cash into a savings account, your money is protected against theft, fire, water, and pest damage. Plus, it can earn a bit of interest, which helps offset the impact of inflation. For the highest rates on your deposits, look for a savings account at a credit union or an online bank.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Can you have too much money in a savings account?</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Saving money is one of the keys to financial stability, but there is such a thing as having too much money in savings accounts.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">For one, federal insurance protects your deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution. If you have a savings account with a balance over $250,000, some of your money could be at risk if your financial institution fails.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Additionally, if you have enough to cover three to six months' worth of living expenses, the only reason to keep more in a savings account is for a specific purchase you'll make in the near future, like a down payment on a home. If that's not the case, you should move your excess funds somewhere where they can earn more interest and outpace inflation, such as a CD or a 401(k).</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Beware of FDIC deposit limits</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures deposits up to $250,000 per account per bank. If you deposit more than that, it won't be protected if the bank fails. Instead, look into holding multiple accounts at different FDIC-insured institutions. This way, all of the money you deposit will be safe in the event of bank failure.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">That said, if you have more than $250,000 to put away, you may want to put some of it into a product that earns a higher interest rate. Your high-yield savings account should contain enough to cover a job loss or other unexpected expense, but anything above that could grow faster in a certificate of deposit (CD), money market account or the stock market. Weigh your short-term needs against your long-term ones to ensure your money works as hard for you as possible.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">For other financial purposes, a different type of account might serve you better. For instance, if you want to make regular deposits and withdrawals to cover day-to-day expenses, you'll want a checking account since savings accounts often limit the number of monthly withdrawals you can make. For long-term goals like retirement, a 401(k) or IRA serves you better because you'll earn more interest in the long run.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Plus, diversifying your money across several different types of accounts can help you maximize your interest and minimize risk. A high-yield savings account is a great financial tool, but it shouldn't be the only one in your tool belt.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">If you're in the market for a high-yield savings account, explore your rates and options here.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Setting your savings priorities</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">In addition to how much you should save, it's important to determine which savings goals to focus on first. As a rule, experts recommend building a healthy emergency savings fund first. Without one, an unexpected setback could easily derail your other financial goals.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Once you have a solid emergency fund in place, you can focus on other savings priorities, such as putting money aside for your child's education, a vacation or a new car.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The bottom line</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Savings are a fundamental part of any financial plan. Part of smart saving is knowing how much of your money to put where. Too little in your account means you might be unable to weather financial storms; too much means your money might not earn as much as it can. Carefully considering your needs and goals can help you strike the right balance when choosing a high-yield savings account and deciding how much to put in it.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p>"
