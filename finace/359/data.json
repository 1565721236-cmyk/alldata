    "section": "What Are Small Tractors?\nSmall tractors are compact, versatile machines designed for light to medium-duty tasks, typically ranging from 15 to 50 horsepower (hp). They are smaller than full-sized agricultural tractors, making them ideal for properties with limited space, such as gardens, small farms, orchards, or residential lots. These tractors often come with interchangeable attachments (e.g., mowers, loaders, tillers) to handle a variety of tasks, from mowing grass to digging trenches or hauling light loads."
