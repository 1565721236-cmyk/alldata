Recommendations of Popular Summer Tire Brands </strong></h2>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. Pirelli </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Pirelli's new Cinturato summer tires are specifically designed for high - end vehicles, covering a variety of types from sedans to crossovers, suitable for both original equipment and replacement markets. They excel in safety, with outstanding braking performance on dry roads. The entire series has achieved an \"A - grade\" rating on the European label for wet roads. Thanks to innovative formula materials, these tires successfully balance the trade - offs among braking grip, mileage durability, and rolling resistance. The mileage has increased by 20% compared to the previous generation, and the reduced rolling resistance helps to save fuel consumption. In addition, they are equipped with Pirelli's exclusive Elect technology, making them compatible with electric and plug - in hybrid vehicles.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Kumho </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Kumho's \"ECSTA HS52\" ranked third overall in the summer tire performance test conducted by the German authoritative automotive magazine <em>ADAC</em>, demonstrating strong capabilities. Its unique asymmetric tread pattern and high - performance silica formula ensure excellent stability during cornering on wet roads, giving drivers full confidence. Meanwhile, the tread block design improves riding comfort. In the 2024 summer tire braking performance evaluation organized by <em>Auto Bild</em>, it ranked second in braking performance.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>3. Sailun </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Sailun's Atrezzo ZSR2 stood out among 52 similar products and entered the top ten in the second round of the 2025 <em>Auto Bild</em> summer tire test, being the only Chinese brand in the top ten. As a \"Liquid Gold\" passenger car product, it performs exceptionally well in key aspects such as dry braking and wet braking. With a wet grip index as high as 1.74, far exceeding the EU A - grade label limit, it can handle both the speed experience on dry roads and the safety guarantee on wet roads with ease.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>4. Continental </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Continental's Premium Contact 6 performed remarkably well in the summer tire test conducted by the Swedish automotive magazine <em>Vi Bilagare</em>. In the dry braking test, it took the top spot with a result of 33.7 meters; its performance in wet braking was equally excellent, achieving a result of 31.6 meters, and it also won first place in the wet control test. Its excellent comprehensive performance makes it a trusted choice for many car owners.</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"> </h2>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>II. Analysis of the Performance Advantages of Summer Tires </strong></h2>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. Dry - road Performance </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Summer tires are designed specifically for high - temperature conditions. Their special material formula reduces rolling resistance, helping to save fuel. The optimized tread hardness and pattern enhance dry - road grip, enabling more sensitive vehicle handling and better braking performance on dry roads. For example, Maxxis Premitra HP5 topped the dry - road handling test with a lap time of 99.9 seconds, showcasing outstanding dry - road performance.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Wet - road Performance </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Summer tires usually have deep water - drainage grooves, which effectively prevent hydroplaning on wet roads and ensure driving safety. Tires like Goodyear EfficientGrip Performance 2 perform well in wet - road conditions and even ranked first with a score of 5 in the subjective noise test.</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"> </h2>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>III. Maintenance Tips for Summer Tires </strong></h2>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. Tire Pressure Check </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">In summer, high temperatures can cause the air inside tires to expand, increasing the tire pressure. Excessively high pressure can accelerate tire wear and even lead to tire blowouts. It is recommended to check the tire pressure once a week and adjust it according to the standard value recommended by the vehicle manufacturer. Generally, the summer tire pressure can be slightly lower than the standard value. Also, ensure that the tire pressures of all four tires are consistent.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Tire Temperature Management </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">In hot weather, tire temperatures can rise rapidly. After a long - distance high - speed drive, the tire temperature may exceed 70&deg;C. At this time, never cool the tires with cold water, as this can cause the tire rubber to crack and deform due to sudden cooling. Instead, park the vehicle in a shaded area and let the tires cool down naturally.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>3. Wear Inspection </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">With frequent rain in summer, road surfaces become slippery, increasing tire wear. Regularly check the tread depth of the tires. When the tread depth is lower than 1.6 millimeters, the tire's water - drainage ability weakens, reducing grip, and the tire should be replaced in a timely manner. Also, pay attention to any abnormal conditions such as bulges or cracks on the tire sidewalls, and replace the tire immediately if found.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>4. Cleaning and Maintenance </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Regularly clean the tires to remove dirt, stones, and other debris from the tread and grooves. These contaminants not only affect tire grip but may also accelerate tire wear. Avoid contact between the tires and chemical substances such as gasoline and motor oil. If contact occurs accidentally, rinse the tires thoroughly with clean water.</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"> </h2>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>IV. Answers to Common Questions about Summer Tires </strong></h2>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>1. Is it necessary to fill tires with nitrogen in summer? </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Nitrogen is an inert gas with minimal thermal expansion and contraction. However, air is mainly composed of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, and it is difficult to evacuate the tire completely when filling it with nitrogen. Through formula derivation, the expansion coefficient of nitrogen is basically the same as that of oxygen, so the effect of filling with nitrogen is negligible. However, if the price of filling with nitrogen is the same as that of ordinary air inflation, it can be considered as an option.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>2. Can all - season tires be used instead of summer tires in summer? </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">All - season tires offer good grip and water - drainage performance throughout the year. However, their dry - road grip and fuel efficiency in high - temperature summer conditions are inferior to those of dedicated summer tires. If the summer temperature in your area is high and you seek better summer driving performance, it is recommended to use summer tires.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>3. How often should tires be replaced? </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Ordinary tires generally need to be replaced every four years or after traveling 60,000 - 80,000 kilometers. If the tires are exposed to frequent sunlight, driven on poor road conditions, or show severe wear in summer, replacement should be done in advance. Also, pay attention to signs of tire aging, such as cracks and hardening, and replace the tires promptly if these occur.</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><strong>4. Is it okay to replace only two summer tires? </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">To ensure vehicle handling and stability, it is best to replace all four tires with summer tires at the same time. Partial replacement may lead to inconsistent tire performance, affecting vehicle braking, steering, and posing potential safety hazards.</p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\">Selecting the right summer tires and performing proper maintenance can make your driving safer and more comfortable in summer. We hope this guide helps you solve many of your questions about summer tires and enables you to travel with ease during the summer months.</p>\n<p class=\"16\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"> </p>"
