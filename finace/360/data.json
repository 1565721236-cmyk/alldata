Vehicles with fewer than 60,000 miles may be overpriced, while those with more than 100,000 miles may require more frequent repairs. However, a well-maintained car with 120,000 miles can still be a good buy.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Should I buy from a dealer or a private seller?</strong> Dealers often offer warranties (even limited ones) and financing options but may charge higher prices. Private sellers may have lower prices but offer no guarantees&mdash;always get a mechanic&rsquo;s inspection first.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>How do I know if a used car is priced fairly?</strong> Use online valuation tools to compare prices for the same make, model, year, and mileage in your area.
