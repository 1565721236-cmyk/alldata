  "section": "According to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the average savings account interest rate is 0.45% APY, but most online savings accounts have much higher interest rates than traditional bank savings accounts. A high-yield savings account works the same as a typical savings account, but can earn more interest, making it a great way to maximize the use of your funds."
