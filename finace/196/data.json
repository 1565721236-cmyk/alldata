When selecting investment products, investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance, financial goals, and investment horizon to choose the right investment tools.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(54, 88, 226); font-size: 19px;\"><strong>What is stock investment?</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company, including a claim on the company's earnings and assets. As such, stockholders are partial owners of the company. When the value of the business rises or falls, so does the value of the stock.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Stocks are generally bought and sold electronically through stock exchanges, the two primary ones in the United States being the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASDAQ). While some companies sell stock directly to investors, most only sell stock through a brokerage such as Schwab.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Investors buy and sell stocks for a number of reasons including the potential to grow the value of their investment over time, to potentially profit from shorter-term stock price moves, or even to earn an income by investing in dividend-paying stocks. The reasoning behind these decisions is often derived from qualitative and quantitative techniques like fundamental analysis or technical analysis. Keep in mind that the price of a stock can fall as easily as it can rise. Investing in stock offers no guarantee that you will make money, and many investors lose money instead. Payment of stock dividends is not guaranteed, and dividends may be discontinued. The underlying common stock is subject to market and business risks including insolvency.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(54, 88, 226); font-size: 19px;\"><strong>What is high-yield bond?</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">High-yield bonds (also called <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/junkbond.asp\" target=\"\">junk bonds</a>) are bonds that pay higher interest rates because they have lower credit ratings than <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentgrade.asp\" target=\"\">investment-grade</a> bonds. High-yield bonds are more likely to default, so they pay a higher yield than investment-grade bonds to compensate investors.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Issuers of high-yield debt tend to be startup companies or capital-intensive firms with high debt ratios. However, some high-yield bonds are <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fallenangel.asp\" target=\"\">fallen angels</a>, which are bonds that lost their good credit ratings.</p><h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul><li>High-yield bonds, or junk bonds, are corporate debt securities that pay higher interest rates than investment-grade bonds.</li><li>High-yield bonds tend to have lower credit ratings of below BBB- from Standard & Poor’s and Fitch, or below Baa3 from Moody’s.</li><li>Junk bonds are more likely to default and have higher price volatility.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(106, 57, 201); font-size: 19px;\"><strong>What is a partial savings account?</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Before committing to putting your money into a fixed or notice deposit account, think about these three things:</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><strong>1. Your investment horizon</strong>. If you have a shorter savings goal – let us, say you want money for a holiday in three months’ time – a notice deposit account may give you a better return for that period, subject to rates on offer at the time. That said, it’s always advisable to shop around and compare various product offerings.  For a longer term goal such as saving for a deposit on a house, you’ll want to find the best return for your investment over one or even two years, which may mean that a fixed deposit would typically be a better option.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><strong>2. Your cash flow needs.</strong> What money will you need to be available now, and what portion can you put away? If you think you’re going to need cash in the short term, you may not want to tie it up into an account where you have to give notice to get your funds out – or to pay a penalty to get them out.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><strong>3. Tax implications.</strong> Over a certain amount, the interest you earn on your investment becomes taxable, so consult a tax professional to find out more about potential tax implications.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Overall, both fixed and  notice deposits can be good investment options if you have money lying around and don’t foresee needing it immediately. Which one you decide to go for depends on the flexibility you have, your cash flow needs, and how long you want to invest your money for. In these times, having extra cash available that is being made off money you already can help you get ahead financially – whether it is to level up your savings or settling existing debt.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(106, 57, 201); font-size: 19px;\"><strong>What is an investment insurance product?</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">There are numerous benefits associated with taking an investment insurance plan. Some of them are listed below:</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><strong>Benefits From Flexible Premiums</strong></span></h3><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The higher the amount of premium, the higher will be the returns. You get the option to pay more than the average premium. When you pay more than the minimum premium amount, the excess amount will get added to your investment, which helps your fund grow faster.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><strong>Funds For Emergencies And Leisure</strong></span></h3><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Having an investment on top of your insurance will help you to earn back some of your investment that you can spend or invest on anything you want. It is advisable to re-invest your ROI to stay on track. With the extra income, you can pay for family emergencies that are not covered in your insurance policies or simply for leisure purposes.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><strong>Higher Returns</strong></span></h3><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Unlike traditional insurance policies, investment insurance helps to maximize your earning potential by linking some of your investments to stocks and bonds, which can result in more enormous funds.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><strong>No Compromise On Your Policy</strong></span></h3><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The investments depend on the state of the market and can result in a loss. The ROI may change depending upon the value of your premiums. However, this will not affect your insurance policy and will not be compromised by the results of your investment.</p>"
