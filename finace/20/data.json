        "<h4>What Is the World Bank?</h4>",
        "<p>Founded in 1944, the World Bank is a group of five institutions collectively working to reduce poverty and promote shared prosperity. Its core entities are:</p>",
        "<p>•International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD): Provides loans and advice to middle-income and creditworthy low-income countries.</p>",
        "<p>•International Development Association (IDA): Offers interest-free loans and grants to the world’s poorest countries.</p>",
        "<p>Other arms include the International Finance Corporation (IFC, for private sector investments), Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA, for political risk insurance), and International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID, for dispute resolution).</p>",
        "<h5>Key Objectives</h5>",
        "<p>•Eradicate extreme poverty (target: reduce the share of people living on less than $2.15/day to below 3% by 2030).</p>",
        "<p>•Promote shared prosperity (boost income growth for the bottom 40% of populations in developing countries).</p>",
        "<p>•Support sustainable development by integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards into projects.</p>",
        "<h5>Focus Areas</h5>",
        "<p>•Poverty reduction: Investments in education, healthcare, and social safety nets.</p>",
        "<p>•Infrastructure: Energy, water, transportation, and urban development (with a strong focus on sustainability).</p>",
        "<p>•Policy reform: Advising governments on economic management, governance, and private sector development.</p>",
        "<h5>Funding and Governance</h5>",
        "<p>•Funding: IBRD raises capital by issuing bonds in global financial markets; IDA is funded by donor country contributions.</p>",
        "<p>•Governance: Member countries (189 total) are represented based on financial contributions, with voting power weighted toward major economies. The U.S. holds the largest share (≈15%), followed by Japan and China.</p>",
        "<h4>What Is the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)?</h4>",
        "<p>Established in 2016, the AIIB is a multilateral development bank focused on financing infrastructure projects in Asia and beyond. With 109 members (as of 2024), it aims to address the region’s massive infrastructure gap—estimated at $1.7 trillion annually—while promoting sustainable development.</p>",
        "<h5>Key Objectives</h5>",
        "<p>•Finance high-quality infrastructure projects (energy, transportation, telecommunications, water, and urban development).</p>",
        "<p>•Foster regional connectivity and economic integration (e.g., supporting cross-border roads, energy grids, and ports).</p>",
        "<p>•Adopt international best practices in environmental and social sustainability, project transparency, and governance.</p>",
        "<h5>Focus Areas</h5>",
        "<p>•Sustainable infrastructure: Renewable energy (solar, wind), green buildings, and climate-resilient projects (flood control, coastal protection).</p>",
        "<p>•Connectivity: Transnational infrastructure to boost trade and economic cooperation (e.g., railways linking Southeast Asian nations).</p>",
        "<p>•Regional development: Projects in less developed Asian economies (e.g., Central Asia, Southeast Asia) to reduce inequality.</p>",
        "<h5>Funding and Governance</h5>",
        "<p>•Funding: Capital is raised through member subscriptions and bond issuances. Initial authorized capital is $100 billion, with China contributing the largest share (≈26%).</p>",
        "<p>•Governance: Decisions are made by a board of governors (one per member), with voting power based on capital subscriptions. Unlike the World Bank, no single country holds veto power.</p>",
        "<h4>Key Differences Between the World Bank and AIIB</h4>",
        "<p>Aspect</p>",
        "<p>World Bank</p>",
        "<p>AIIB</p>",
        "<p>Geographic Focus</p>",
        "<p>Global, with a strong focus on low-income countries worldwide.</p>",
        "<p>Primarily Asia, with expanding projects in Africa, Latin America, and Europe.</p>",
        "<p>Primary Mission</p>",
        "<p>Poverty reduction and broad development (social, economic, institutional).</p>",
        "<p>Infrastructure development and regional connectivity.</p>",
        "<p>Project Scope</p>",
        "<p>Diverse: Education, healthcare, agriculture, and infrastructure.</p>",
        "<p>Narrower: Focused on infrastructure (energy, transport, water, urban).</p>",
        "<p>Governance</p>",
        "<p>Weighted voting (major economies have more influence); U.S. holds de facto veto.</p>",
        "<p>More balanced voting; no single-country veto.</p>",
        "<p>Operational Speed</p>",
        "<p>Longer approval processes due to strict ESG and policy conditions.</p>",
        "<p>Streamlined approval to accelerate project implementation.</p>",
        "<p>Sustainability Focus</p>",
        "<p>Integrates ESG into all projects but has faced criticism for slow adaptation to climate urgency.</p>",
        "<p>Explicitly prioritizes green infrastructure and climate resilience from inception.</p>",
        "<h4>Collaboration and Overlap</h4>",
        "<p>While differing in focus, the World Bank and AIIB often collaborate on joint projects, leveraging their respective strengths:</p>",
        "<p>•Co-financing: Partnering on large-scale projects (e.g., a 2023 renewable energy initiative in Bangladesh, with the World Bank advising on policy and AIIB financing construction).</p>",
        "<p>•Knowledge sharing: AIIB adopts World Bank standards for environmental and social safeguards, while the World Bank learns from AIIB’s agile project delivery.</p>",
        "<p>•Complementary roles: The World Bank supports social development (schools, hospitals) alongside infrastructure, while AIIB fills gaps in regional connectivity.</p>",
        "<h4>FAQs About the World Bank and AIIB</h4>",
        "<p>•Q: Do the World Bank and AIIB compete for projects?</p>",
        "<p>A: Occasionally, but competition is limited. The World Bank focuses on poverty and social projects, while AIIB specializes in infrastructure. Many countries use both: e.g., a nation might secure World Bank funds for healthcare and AIIB loans for a new port.</p>",
        "<p>•Q: How do countries qualify for loans from these institutions?</p>",
        "<p>A: For the World Bank, IBRD requires creditworthiness; IDA is limited to low-income countries. AIIB requires membership (open to all nations) and projects that align with its infrastructure/connectivity goals.</p>",
        "<p>•Q: Are loans from these banks conditional?</p>",
        "<p>A: The World Bank often attaches policy conditions (e.g., reducing government subsidies, improving governance). AIIB has fewer conditions, focusing instead on project viability and sustainability.</p>",
        "<p>•Q: How do they ensure projects are sustainable?</p>",
        "<p>A: Both require environmental and social impact assessments. The World Bank has strict guidelines (e.g., resettlement plans for displaced communities); AIIB mandates carbon footprint reporting and green technology use.</p>",
        "<p>•Q: Can non-Asian countries join AIIB?</p>",
        "<p>A: Yes—AIIB is open to global membership. As of 2024, non-Asian members include France, Germany, Brazil, and South Africa, reflecting its global reach.</p>",
        "<h4>Impact on Global Development</h4>",
        "<p>•World Bank: Has funded iconic projects (e.g., India’s rural electrification, Bangladesh’s microfinance expansion) and played a key role in reducing global poverty from 36% (1990) to 9.2% (2020).</p>",
        "<p>•AIIB: In its first decade, it has financed over 200 projects, including solar farms in Egypt, highway upgrades in Pakistan, and a metro system in Indonesia, boosting regional trade and green energy access.</p>",
        "<p>The World Bank and AIIB serve distinct but complementary roles in global development. The World Bank’s broad mandate addresses poverty through multifaceted projects, while AIIB’s focus on infrastructure fills a critical gap in Asia and beyond. Their collaboration underscores the need for diverse approaches to tackle complex challenges—from climate change to inequality—ensuring more inclusive and sustainable growth for all nations.</p>"
