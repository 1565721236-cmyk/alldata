They are suitable for long-term investment loans, such as funding property development or expanding a real estate portfolio. Lenders usually offer LTV ratios of 60-80% based on appraised values.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Marketable Securities</strong>: Stocks, bonds, and ETFs with high liquidity are preferred for short-term investment loans. For example, blue-chip stocks may have an LTV ratio of 50-70%, while government bonds can reach 70-80% due to their lower risk.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Precious Metals and Artworks</strong>: Gold, silver, and high-value artworks can be used, but with lower LTV ratios (30-50%) due to valuation difficulties and market volatility. They are often chosen by investors with diverse asset portfolios.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Business Assets</strong>: For business investors, equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable can secure loans to invest in business expansion, new product development, or market expansion.

Lenders assess the asset's value through professional appraisals, market research, and analysis of historical performance. For instance, a stock portfolio's value is evaluated using its average trading price over a certain period.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">2. </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Loan Application and Negotiation</strong>: Investors submit loan applications, stating the investment purpose and the collateral details. Both parties negotiate loan amount (based on LTV), interest rate (usually 2-7% depending on asset risk), repayment period (1-15 years), and other terms.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">3. </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Legal Documentation and Agreement Signing</strong>: A formal loan agreement is signed, specifying the rights and obligations of both parties, including collateral management, repayment schedule, and default handling. A lien is placed on the collateral to protect the lender's interests.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">4. </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Fund Disbursement and Investment Implementation</strong>: After the agreement is signed, the lender disburses the funds. Investors use the capital to carry out investment activities, such as purchasing additional securities, investing in startups, or acquiring assets.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">5. </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Repayment and Collateral Release</strong>: Investors make regular repayments according to the schedule. Once the loan is fully repaid, the lender releases the lien, and the investor regains full ownership of the collateral.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Advantages of Investment Collateral</strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Maintaining Asset Ownership</strong>: Investors can obtain funds without selling their assets, avoiding potential capital gains taxes and retaining the possibility of asset appreciation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Lower Financing Costs</strong>: Compared to unsecured loans, investment collateral loans have lower interest rates, reducing the cost of investment capital.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Flexible Use of Funds</strong>: The borrowed funds can be used for various investment purposes, providing investors with greater flexibility in capital allocation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Improving Capital Efficiency</strong>: By leveraging existing assets, investors can expand their investment scale and potentially increase returns.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Risks and Mitigation Strategies</strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Asset Depreciation Risk</strong>: If the collateral's value drops significantly, the LTV ratio may exceed the agreed limit, leading to a margin call.

    "section": "What Is Investment Collateral?\nInvestment collateral refers to assets that investors pledge to lenders to secure funds for further investment activities. It acts as a form of security, giving lenders recourse if the borrower fails to repay the loan. This mechanism allows investors to access capital without liquidating their existing holdings, enabling them to seize new investment opportunities while maintaining potential growth from their original assets."
