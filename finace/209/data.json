In the downtown area of Boston, many ancient buildings have been transformed into distinctive residences, preserving a strong historical atmosphere. For example, some row houses located on Lighthouse Mountain have exquisite architectural exteriors and exquisite interior decorations, which are highly favored by homebuyers.

Apartments located in the city center and commercial district have higher prices, but convenient transportation and easy living; Apartments located in the suburbs have relatively low prices, quiet environments, and are suitable for living.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">3、 Residential prices and market trends</span></p>\n<p><br><strong>Price range:</strong> Residential prices in Massachusetts vary depending on factors such as region, housing type, and area.
