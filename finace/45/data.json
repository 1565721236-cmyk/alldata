        "<p>•Service history: Ask for a detailed maintenance log. Regular oil changes, tire rotations, and brake checks indicate the previous owner cared for the car.</p>",
        "<p>•Vehicle history report: Use a service to check for accidents, flood damage, or title issues (e.g., salvage titles). A clean history is critical for reliability.</p>",
        "<p>•Test drive: Spend 20–30 minutes driving on different roads (highways, city streets) to check for unusual noises, shaky steering, or slow acceleration.</p>",
        "<p>•Pre-purchase inspection: Pay a mechanic (100–200) to inspect the car. They can spot hidden issues like worn suspension or engine problems.</p>",
        "<h4>Price Ranges and What to Expect</h4>",
        "<p>•Under [Low Price]: You’ll find older models (2015–2017) with higher mileage but basic reliability. Focus on hatchbacks or compact cars with minimal features.</p>",
        "<p>•[Mid Price Range]: 2018–2020 models with 50,000–80,000 miles, offering more features (e.g., backup cameras, smartphone integration) and better fuel efficiency.</p>",
        "<p>•[Upper Budget Range]: 2020–2022 models with low mileage, including midsize sedans or SUVs with advanced safety features (e.g., lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring).</p>",
        "<h4>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h4>",
        "<p>•Ignoring reliability ratings: Don’t buy a model known for frequent breakdowns, even if it’s cheap. Check consumer reports for models with poor reliability scores.</p>",
        "<p>•Overlooking insurance costs: Sports cars or luxury models may have higher insurance premiums, eating into your “savings.” Get insurance quotes before buying.</p>",
        "<p>•Falling for cosmetic flaws: A few dents or scratches are fine, but avoid cars with rust (especially undercarriage) or mismatched paint (a sign of unreported accidents).</p>",
        "<p>•Skipping the test drive: Never buy a car sight unseen. Even if it looks good on paper, a test drive can reveal mechanical issues.</p>",
        "<h4>How to Negotiate the Best Price</h4>",
        "<p>•Research market value: Use online tools to see what similar models are selling for in your area. This gives you leverage to negotiate.</p>",
        "<p>•Point out flaws: If the inspection reveals minor issues (e.g., worn tires, a broken speaker), use them to ask for a lower price.</p>",
        "<p>•Be ready to walk away: Sellers are more likely to lower the price if they think you’ll leave. Don’t feel pressured to buy on the spot.</p>",
        "<h4>FAQs About Buying High-Value Used Cars</h4>",
        "<p>•How old is too old for a used car?Models 5–7 years old are often the sweet spot—old enough to have depreciated significantly but new enough to have modern safety features.</p>",
        "<p>•Should I buy from a dealer or private seller?Dealers may offer warranties (short-term) but charge higher prices. Private sellers often have lower prices but no guarantees.</p>",
        "<p>•What if I can’t afford a mechanic inspection?Ask the seller to provide a recent inspection report, or look for cars sold with a “certified pre-owned” label (these undergo rigorous checks).</p>",
        "<p>•Is it better to buy a car with cash or finance?Cash avoids interest, but low-interest loans (under 5%) can let you afford a newer, more reliable model.</p>",
        "<p>With the right research and careful inspection, a high性价比used car can provide years of reliable service. Whether you prioritize fuel efficiency, space, or low maintenance costs, the models listed here offer a starting point for finding a vehicle that fits your needs and budget.
