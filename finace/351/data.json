Unlike traditional models where batteries must be detached for charging or transport, these wheelchairs feature an integrated battery that stays in place even when folded. The \"portability optimized\" label highlights enhancements such as lightweight materials, compact folding mechanisms, and space-saving designs, making them ideal for travel, storage in small spaces, and easy transportation in vehicles.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Key Design Features for Portability</strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Integrated Battery System</strong>: The battery is seamlessly built into the wheelchair&rsquo;s frame, eliminating the need for removal during folding, charging, or transit.
