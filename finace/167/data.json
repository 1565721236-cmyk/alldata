Maybe a small van with a lower roof height for stealth parking. Do you need lots of cargo space?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><span style=\"color: var(--colorTextBody);\">We've highlighted the most popular vehicles used for living full-time on the road, but this certainly isn't a list of your only options.<br></span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: start;\">The 3 Best Vans for Conversion at a Glance</h2><p><br></p><p></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Ford Transit：</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Pros：</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Various sizes、2WD, AWD, and 4×4 options、Quality gas engine、One of the more reliable vans、Growing pool of aftermarket 、Mechanic-friendlyoptions.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The Ford Transit van conversion has become very popular very quickly. This van’s gas engine works well, and it can be fixed at almost any auto shop. Parts are also usually easy to find.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Since turning a Ford Transit into a camper is becoming more common, there are also a lot of aftermarket parts for these versatile vehicles. You can pick up one with 2WD and AWD options. Besides, you can even convert a 2WD into a 4×4 ultimate adventure vehicle.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Another great thing about the Ford Transit is that it can be bought in three different lengths and heights. Hence, it can fit any need.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Mercedes Sprinter：</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Pros：</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Versatile、2WD, 4WD options、Longevity、Lots of aftermarket options、Stylish</span></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">If you can afford it, the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is probably the best choice. These <a href=\"https://www.highlandvans.com/blog/camper-van-conversion-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">camper van conversions</a> cost the most, and for good reason.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">People who are willing to shell out big bucks for a <a href=\"https://www.highlandvans.com/blog/diy-vs-professional-van-conversion/\" target=\"_blank\">professional camper van conversion</a> typically request vans like this one. That’s why commercial van conversion companies also love Mercedes Sprinters.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Many say that the style and luxury of the Mercedes Sprinter van conversion make it the best van on the market. Besides, this cargo van is more reliable and easier to drive than some others.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The Mercedes Sprinter van is a widespread choice for people who want to make a long-lasting investment. That’s because it comes with a long-lasting diesel engine. However, you will need to check gas stations often to make sure they have diesel. To be safe, it is best to fill up at truck stops, where diesel fuel is always available.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">There are a lot of aftermarket upfitting options for this vehicle because it is so popular. With both 2WD and 4WD options, it is a great vehicle for off-road adventures. If you do not want to measure and cut everything yourself, you can buy the whole kit for the inside of your Sprinter van.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(94, 94, 94); font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Dodge Ram Promaster：</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(94, 94, 94); font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Pros：</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Most interior space for building、Boxy style easier for conversions、Easy to include lots of storage space、Decent gas mileage for its size</span></p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The Dodge Ram Promaster cargo van is perfect for camper conversions because there is more room to design the van of your dreams. It has a wider shell with fewer curves on the walls and ceilings. This makes it perfect for van builds.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Unlike the other camper vans, the Ram Promaster van is front-wheel-drive only. Even though it is not as fancy as the Sprinter or Transit cargo vans, a lot of people like it because it is cheaper.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">However, compared to other cargo vans, it does not have much ground clearance. Hence, it can not be driven on some surfaces.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">There are numerous professional Ram Promaster van conversion businesses. This is because constructing a Promaster van is simpler than converting a Sprinter van. Also, it costs less to convert this van.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><ul><li style=\"text-align: start;\"><strong>Van Maximum Weights (GVW)</strong></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) ratings for most panel vans are 3.5 tons. That is the most weight it can hold, with the van itself, the conversion, people, diesel, water, clothes, and tools.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">It can get hard to keep track of weights, but you need to know how much your van can hold and stick to that. If you are caught with a van that is too full, you could get a big fine or even lose points.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">If you need more space and like to carry a motorcycle or other heavy gear, check out Mercedes Sprinters that begin with the number 5, like 516 or 519. These have a GVW of 5 tons. A GVW of 5.5 tons is available for 4×4 models.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">For any vehicle that weighs more than 3.5 tons, you will need a C1 category on your license. You might need an extra test to get this, depending on your age.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><ul><li style=\"text-align: start;\"><strong>Purpose of Using</strong></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The intended use of the van is a crucial factor to consider when <a href=\"https://www.highlandvans.com/brands/\" target=\"_blank\">selecting the ideal vehicle for your needs</a>. Here are some possible scenarios:</p><ul><li style=\"text-align: start;\">Stealth: Choosing a stealthy van is key if you’re often around cities. It reduces break-ins and makes parking easier at night.</li><li style=\"text-align: start;\">Full-time: For those living in their vans full-time, having a high roof matters for comfort and better posture.</li><li style=\"text-align: start;\">Got a partner? If traveling with a partner, consider getting a longer, wider van to avoid cramped sleeping spaces.</li><li style=\"text-align: start;\">Weather: Spending time inside during cold or wet conditions means wanting more room to move and stand up comfortably. In extremely cold places, insulating your van can lower the ceiling height. Aim for an extra-high-roofed vehicle to compensate.</li></ul><p style=\"text-align: start;\"><br></p><ul><li style=\"text-align: start;\"><strong>Mileage</strong></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: start;\">You will not have to worry about mileage if you buy a new van. But if you choose a used van, mileage is something you’ll need to look at. Consider:</p><ul><li style=\"text-align: start;\">How much of a budget do you have?</li><li style=\"text-align: start;\">How long do you plan on owning the van?</li><li style=\"text-align: start;\">How far do you hope to travel in it?</li><li style=\"text-align: start;\">How often do you plan on going away?</li></ul><p style=\"text-align: start;\">It probably will not make or break the deal, but the less mileage a car has, the better. This may cost more, though, so you will need to think about the pros and cons.</p>"
