Typically, one party pays a fixed interest rate, and the other pays a floating rate (e.g., based on LIBOR, SOFR, or another benchmark). For example, a company with a floating-rate loan might swap to a fixed rate to avoid rising borrowing costs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs)</strong>: A contract between two parties to lock in an interest rate for a future period. One party agrees to pay a fixed rate, while the other pays a floating rate based on the market rate at the contract&rsquo;s start date. FRAs are often used to hedge short-term interest rate risk.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Interest Rate Futures</strong>: Standardized contracts traded on exchanges that obligate parties to buy or sell a financial instrument (e.g., a Treasury bond) at a future date at a predetermined interest rate. They are used to hedge or speculate on interest rate movements with high liquidity.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Interest Rate Options</strong>: Contracts that give the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to enter into an interest rate transaction at a specified rate on or before a future date. Common types include:</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">◦ </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Caps</strong>: Protect against rising rates by setting a maximum interest rate.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">◦ </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Floors</strong>: Protect against falling rates by setting a minimum interest rate.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">◦ </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Collars</strong>: Combine a cap and a floor to limit interest rate fluctuations within a range.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Swaptions</strong>: Options on interest rate swaps, giving the holder the right to enter into a swap at a future date at a predetermined rate. They provide flexibility to hedge or speculate on swap rates.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How Do Interest Rate Derivatives Work?</strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Interest rate derivatives derive their value from changes in underlying interest rates. For example:</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]-->In an interest rate swap, if floating rates rise, the party paying the floating rate will owe more, while the fixed-rate payer benefits. If rates fall, the opposite occurs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]-->A forward rate agreement settles in cash based on the difference between the agreed fixed rate and the market&rsquo;s floating rate at the contract&rsquo;s start. If the market rate is higher than the fixed rate, the floating-rate payer compensates the fixed-rate payer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]-->Interest rate futures gain or lose value as bond prices (which move inversely to interest rates) change. A trader betting on rising rates might sell futures, profiting as bond prices fall.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Key Uses of Interest Rate Derivatives</strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Hedging</strong>: Businesses with loans or investments sensitive to interest rates use derivatives to reduce risk. For example, a bank with a portfolio of fixed-rate mortgages might use swaps to convert fixed payments into floating ones, matching its floating-rate liabilities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Speculation</strong>: Traders and investors use derivatives to profit from predicted interest rate movements. A speculator expecting rates to rise might buy interest rate caps or sell futures contracts.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Arbitrage</strong>: Taking advantage of price differences between related instruments.

Models such as the Black-Scholes model (for options) or swap pricing formulas are used to calculate fair value.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>What happens if interest rates become negative?</strong> Negative rates can affect derivative valuations, but most contracts include provisions to handle this scenario (e.g., adjusting payment calculations or setting floors at zero).</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>How are interest rate derivatives regulated?</strong> They are subject to oversight by financial regulators, with requirements for centralized clearing (to reduce counterparty risk), trade reporting, and capital reserves. Standardized contracts often trade on regulated exchanges.</span></p>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&bull; </span><!--[endif]--><strong>What is the difference between a swap and a forward rate agreement?</strong> Swaps involve multiple payments over time, while FRAs are single-settlement contracts. Swaps are more flexible for long-term hedging, while FRAs are simpler for short-term needs.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Interest rate derivatives are powerful tools for managing interest rate risk, speculating on market movements, and optimizing financial strategies. By understanding their types, uses, and risks, businesses and investors can leverage these instruments to navigate volatile interest rate environments effectively. While they require careful consideration of complexity and risk, when used appropriately, interest rate derivatives play a vital role in modern financial markets, enhancing stability and enabling more efficient capital allocation.</span></p>"

    "section": "What Are Interest Rate Derivatives?\nInterest rate derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from underlying interest rates or interest rate instruments (such as government bonds). They are used by individuals, businesses, and financial institutions to manage (hedge) interest rate risk, speculate on future rate movements, or gain exposure to specific interest rate markets. These instruments allow parties to lock in, cap, floor, or swap interest rates, providing flexibility in navigating fluctuating market conditions."
