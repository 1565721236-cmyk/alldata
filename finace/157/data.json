        "<p dir=\"auto\"><img src=\"157_content_1.jpg\"></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The impact of Tesla's Model 3 on the New Zealand market was profound, particularly as it coincided with the peak of the Clean Car Discount, attracting a multitude of buyers. However, with the arrival of the Tesla Model Y, preferences swiftly shifted towards SUVs.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">While most traditional automakers might consider launching a new model by now, Tesla has instead opted for a comprehensive overhaul.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Although the overall appearance remains largely familiar, notable changes can be seen in the fresh front end design featuring sleeker lights and a reshaped nose, complemented by a refined rear profile. These modifications enhance aerodynamics, with the Cd now standing at 0.219, translating to extended range without the need for a larger battery. Likely, numerous software and minor hardware enhancements have been incorporated to further augment efficiency, although Tesla typically remains discreet about specifics. The update also emphasizes refining the vehicle, with reduced wind noise among the benefits of its newfound smoothness. Enhanced sealing, double glazing, improved suspension components, and increased sound insulation further contribute to a superior driving experience. Reports affirm that the body structure has also been bolstered.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Pricing and Specs</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The latest iteration of the Model 3 now commences at $65,900 (or $68,000 on-road) for the rear-wheel-drive variant, with a $10,000 increment for the dual-motor, long-range model. Unfortunately, the Clean Car Discount is no longer applicable, and as of March 31st, electric vehicle buyers may need to bear additional road user charges, signaling a less favorable circumstance.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Technical Breakdown</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Tesla remains somewhat tight-lipped regarding detailed specifications, merely disclosing a maximum range of 513 kilometers and an acceleration time from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.1 seconds. Research reveals the presence of a 57kWh battery, considered modest for a well-proportioned sedan, utilizing an LFP cathode material. Motor performance is rated at 208kW, with 420Nm of torque. Charging capabilities are 11kW AC and 170kW DC, while features such as vehicle-to-grid integration are noticeably absent. Tesla's efficiency prowess is evident, with the Model 3 claiming consumption figures between 10-13kWh per 100 kilometers.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Interior Enhancements</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The central screen reigns supreme, overseeing an expanded array of functions. Tesla has eliminated stalks from the column, shifting drive selection to the touchscreen interface. Alternatively, the vehicle can autonomously determine the appropriate direction. Despite initial apprehensions, the system operates smoothly (albeit with occasional hiccups), leveraging the Model 3's cameras to navigate forward and reverse movements. As for interior quality, discernible improvements are notable; the materials withstand initial quality assessments, though finer finishing in less prominent areas still warrants enhancement. Carpet quality falls short, lacking a kick plate finisher on the sizable sill, which slightly impedes entry.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Driving Experience</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The drive exudes effortless elegance, with refined ride quality on urban streets and subdued suspension noise. Exceptional outward visibility, responsive steering, and manageable turning radius highlight its ease of maneuverability. While lacking a 360-degree monitor, the three parking cameras suffice adequately. Power delivery is finely tuned, seamless, and instant in torque response. Motor regenerative settings are fixed for a one-pedal driving mode, ensuring a smooth deceleration. Brake pedal engagement feels natural and intuitive.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Verdict</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This rendition represents a commendable evolution over its predecessor, demonstrating remarkable resilience in competing against newer models. The competitive pricing is indeed noteworthy. Tesla's relentless commitment to refining unseen elements underscores its ethos. As the revered figure within the company often emphasizes, Tesla is not merely an automotive manufacturer but an 'AI and robotics firm that makes cars'.</p>\n<p><strong>Model</strong></p>\n<p>Tesla Model 3 Rear Wheel Drive</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong></p>\n<p>$65,900</p>\n<p><strong>Motor</strong></p>\n<p>208kW, 420Nm</p>\n<p><strong>Battery</strong></p>\n<p>57.5kWh net</p>\n<p><strong>Range</strong></p>\n<p>513km</p>\n<p><strong>Drivetrain</strong></p>\n<p>Single-speed auto, RWD</p>\n<p><strong>Energy Use</strong></p>\n<p>10-13kWh/100km</p>\n<p><strong>C02 Output</strong></p>\n<p>0g/km</p>\n<p><strong>0-100km/h</strong></p>\n<p>6.31sec</p>\n<p><strong>80-120km/h</strong></p>\n<p>3.65sec (102m)</p>\n<p><strong>100-0km/h</strong></p>\n<p>34.90m</p>\n<p><strong>Stability systems</strong></p>\n<p>ABS, ESP, TV</p>\n<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>\n<p>AEB, ACC, BSM, LDW, <br>RCTA, ALK, AHB</p>\n<p><strong>Luggage capacity</strong></p>\n<p>88-594L</p>\n<p><strong>Tow rating</strong></p>\n<p>750kg (1000kg braked)</p>\n<p><strong>Service intervals</strong></p>\n<p>refer to Tesla website</p>\n<p><strong>Warranty</strong></p>\n<p>4yrs, 80,000km</p>\n<p><strong>ANCAP rating</strong></p>\n<p>5 Stars (2019)</p>\n<p><strong>Weight</strong></p>\n<p>1836kg (claimed)</p>"
