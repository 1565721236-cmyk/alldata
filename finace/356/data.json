    "section": "What Is Corporate Legal Counsel?\nCorporate legal counsel refers to legal professionals or teams that provide ongoing legal support to businesses, with a focus on two core areas: year-round compliance management and legal guidance for critical strategic decisions. These advisors act as trusted partners, helping companies navigate complex legal landscapes, mitigate risks, and ensure operations align with applicable laws and regulations. Unlike transactional lawyers who handle specific cases, corporate legal counsel maintains a long-term relationship with the business, offering proactive advice tailored to its unique goals and challenges."
