        "<h3>Key Tips for Buying a Cost-Effective Used Car</h3>",
        "<p>1.Set a Realistic Budget: Include not just the purchase price but also insurance, registration, and potential immediate repairs (e.g., new tires, brake pads). A good rule is to spend no more than 15–20% of your annual income on a used car.</p>",
        "<p>2.Check Vehicle History Reports: Use reputable services to review accident history, title status (avoid salvage titles), and maintenance records. A clean history with regular oil changes and service checks is a strong indicator of reliability.</p>",
        "<p>3.Inspect the Car Thoroughly:</p>",
        "<p>◦Exterior: Look for rust, uneven paint (signaling past damage), and mismatched panels.</p>",
        "<p>◦Interior: Check for worn seats, functional electronics (lights, windows, AC), and signs of water damage (musty odors, mold).</p>",
        "<p>◦Mechanical: Have a trusted mechanic perform a pre-purchase inspection. They can spot hidden issues like engine leaks, transmission problems, or worn suspension.</p>",
        "<p>1.Test Drive: Pay attention to how the car handles—unusual noises, shaky steering, or delayed acceleration may indicate problems. Test it on both city streets and highways.</p>",
        "<p>2.Negotiate Based on Condition: Use the vehicle history and inspection results to negotiate the price. Cars with known issues or high mileage should be priced lower than market averages.</p>",
        "<h3>Common Questions About Buying Cost-Effective Used Cars</h3>",
        "<p>•What’s the best mileage range for a used car?Aim for 60,000–100,000 miles. Vehicles with fewer than 60,000 miles may be overpriced, while those with more than 100,000 miles may require more frequent repairs. However, a well-maintained car with 120,000 miles can still be a good buy.</p>",
        "<p>•Should I buy from a dealer or a private seller?Dealers often offer warranties (even limited ones) and financing options but may charge higher prices. Private sellers may have lower prices but offer no guarantees—always get a mechanic’s inspection first.</p>",
        "<p>•How do I know if a used car is priced fairly?Use online valuation tools to compare prices for the same make, model, year, and mileage in your area. Adjust for condition: a car with new tires or recent service may be worth slightly more.</p>",
        "<p>•Is it better to buy a certified pre-owned (CPO) car?CPO cars undergo rigorous inspections and come with extended warranties, but they cost more than non-certified used cars. They’re a good choice if you want extra peace of mind but are willing to pay a premium.</p>",
        "<p>•What should I avoid when buying a used car?Steer clear of models with a history of frequent recalls, expensive repair records, or known issues (e.g., faulty transmissions). Also, avoid cars with salvage titles (rebuilt after severe damage) or incomplete maintenance records.</p>",
