    "section": "What Are Lightweight Long-Range Lithium-Ion Electric Wheelchairs?\nLightweight long-range lithium-ion electric wheelchairs are mobility aids designed to combine portability with extended battery life, making them ideal for both daily use and travel. Powered by high-capacity lithium-ion batteries—known for their energy density and lightweight properties—these wheelchairs offer a balance of maneuverability, durability, and range. Unlike traditional lead-acid battery wheelchairs, which are heavier and have shorter lifespans, lithium-ion models prioritize ease of transport (often foldable or disassemblable) while providing enough power to cover significant distances on a single charge."
