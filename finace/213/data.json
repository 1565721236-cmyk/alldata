        "<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><img src=\"213_content_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1456\" height=\"816\"></span></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">1、 The current situation and needs of disabled people's travel</span></strong><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The trend of population aging is significant, and various factors such as accidents and congenital diseases have led to a significant number of disabled people. In daily travel, they face many inconveniences. Although public transportation has gradually improved its accessibility facilities, it is still difficult to fully meet the personalized and real-time travel needs. Especially for those disabled people with limited mobility but certain control abilities, they long for exclusive and convenient transportation tools that can autonomously shuttle through the streets and alleys of the city, go to work, shop, socialize, and integrate into the normal pace of social life.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">2、 Types and characteristics of disability specific motorcycles</span></strong><br><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">（1） Three wheeled disabled motorcycle</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Stability advantage: This type of motorcycle usually adopts a front two or front two rear one three wheel layout, with a wide wheelbase and a lower center of gravity design, making it highly stable during driving and less prone to rollover. Whether it is flat city roads or slightly sloping suburban paths, they can travel smoothly, greatly ensuring the safety of drivers. For example, a well-known American brand's three wheeled disabled motorcycle has a specially designed rear wheel suspension system that can adapt to road bumps, ensuring a smooth body and allowing drivers to travel with peace of mind.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Convenience of carrying: Some three wheeled models are equipped with rear or side storage boxes, which have a considerable capacity and are convenient for people with disabilities to carry essential items such as wheelchairs, crutches, shopping bags, etc. for travel. Some car models also feature waterproof and anti-theft storage compartments, which are both practical and thoughtful, fully considering the various needs of people with disabilities when traveling alone.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">（2） Four wheeled disabled motorcycle</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Similar to car handling experience: incorporating some of the handling characteristics of a car, equipped with steering wheel, brake pedal, accelerator pedal, etc., allowing disabled people who are accustomed to driving cars to quickly get started. The interior space is relatively spacious, allowing drivers to comfortably stretch their limbs and reduce fatigue from prolonged driving. In some European countries, this four wheeled disabled motorcycle is highly favored by disabled people who have good upper limb strength and pursue driving comfort.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">High tech assisted driving function: Many high-end four-wheel disabled motorcycles integrate advanced assisted driving technology, such as automatic brake assist, lane departure warning, reverse image, etc., like equipping the driver with an invisible driving assistant, further improving driving safety. These features are crucial safety measures for disabled drivers who may have slightly slower reaction times.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">（3） Hand controlled disabled motorcycle</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Fine Hand Control: Designed specifically for people with limited hand control but lower limb disabilities, the throttle, brake and other control devices are integrated into the car handle. Through special lever, button or knob mechanisms, drivers only need to gently rotate their wrists and press their fingers to accurately control the speed and parking. Taking a German brand of hand controlled motorcycles as an example, its braking system adopts a progressive braking design, and the force of hand operation is linearly related to the braking effect, allowing the driver to finely control it.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Personalized customization: The height of the manual control device can be customized according to the driver's arm length and strength, ensuring comfort and convenience in operation. The seat height, backrest angle, pedal position, etc. can also be adjusted as needed, truly meeting the physical condition of each disabled person and achieving an exclusive customized driving experience.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">3、 Relevant policy support from European and American countries</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Car purchase subsidies: Many European and American governments provide substantial car purchase subsidies to encourage people with disabilities to purchase specialized motorcycles. In the United States, eligible disabled individuals who purchase designated models of disability specific motorcycles can receive subsidies of up to 50% of the vehicle price, reducing economic burden and enabling more people to have their own means of transportation.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Convenient parking: In urban planning, a large number of free or discounted parking areas have been designated specifically for disabled motorcycles, usually near the entrances and exits of destinations such as shopping malls, hospitals, and offices, making it easy for disabled people to reach quickly. These exclusive parking spaces are clearly marked and spacious in size, ensuring convenient parking and boarding of vehicles.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Road permits and insurance benefits: Disabled motorcycles can obtain legal road permits and enjoy preferential policies in terms of insurance as long as they pass specific safety checks. Compared to ordinary motorcycles, their insurance rates have been significantly reduced, and some countries also have insurance plans specifically for disabled vehicles, covering various aspects such as vehicle maintenance and driver accident protection, providing comprehensive protection for travel.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">4、 Brand and Market</span></strong><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There are numerous well-known disability specific motorcycle brands emerging in the European and American markets. Pride Mobility in the United States, with years of research and development experience and a wide dealer network, offers a diverse range of vehicle options, from entry-level economical and practical models to high-end intelligent technology models; Kymco from the UK is widely popular on the European continent for its exquisite craftsmanship and precise understanding of the needs of people with disabilities in Europe. Its products focus on detail design, such as ergonomic optimization of seats and simple and easy-to-use control interfaces; In addition, BMW from Germany has also ventured into this field, shifting the high-end technology of automobile manufacturing and creating a disability specific motorcycle that combines performance and quality. Although the price is relatively high, it attracts consumers who pursue the ultimate with its excellent reliability and driving experience.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">5、 Future prospects</span></strong><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">With the continuous advancement of technology, disability specific motorcycles are expected to see more innovative breakthroughs. On the one hand, the innovation of battery technology will promote the development of electric disabled motorcycles, achieving longer range, faster charging, and reducing environmental impact; On the other hand, intelligent connectivity technology will be deeply integrated, and vehicles can be connected in real-time with family members, medical institutions, rescue centers, etc. In case of emergency, they can receive timely assistance, making travel safer and more worry free for people with disabilities. I believe that with the joint efforts of all sectors of society, disability specific motorcycles will continue to evolve and become a solid bridge for people with disabilities to lead a free life.</span></p>\n<p> </p>"
