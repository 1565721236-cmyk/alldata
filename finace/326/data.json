In 2024, global semiconductor sales reached 149.9 billion in the second quarter, marking an 18.3% increase compared to the same period in 2023. Total global sales are projected to hit 588 billion by the end of the year, representing a 13% increase from 2023. This growth is driven by a confluence of factors, chief among them being the burgeoning demand for advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), data center solutions, and the continuous expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT).</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Performance of Key Semiconductor Giants</strong></span></h3>\n<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>NVIDIA</strong></span></h4>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">NVIDIA has emerged as a dominant force in the semiconductor space, especially in the realm of AI. With a market capitalization of a staggering 2.97 trillion, it has solidified its position as a market leader. In 2024, NVIDIA's stock has been on an upward trajectory, with a year - to - date (YTD) increase of 149.4% and a 52 - week jump of 192.5%. The company reported record quarterly revenue of 30 billion during the second quarter, a whopping 122% increase from the previous year. GAAP earnings per diluted share were 0.67. NVIDIA's dominance in the GPU market, where it commands an 88% market share, is a significant driver of this growth. Looking ahead, NVIDIA expects third - quarter revenue to hit 32.5 billion, with gross margins in the mid - 70% range. This positive outlook reflects the company's confidence in the continued demand for its products and technologies in AI - related applications, including gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive solutions.</span></p>\n<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Samsung</strong></span></h4>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Samsung, a major player in the semiconductor industry, particularly in memory chips, has had a mixed performance. In 2024, Samsung Electronics reclaimed the top spot among global semiconductor vendors with revenues of $66.52 billion, a 62.5% increase from the previous year. Its HBM3E product, which started mass production and sales in the third quarter of 2024, has been a significant revenue generator, with sales surpassing that of HBM3 in the fourth quarter. Additionally, its 16 - layer product is in the customer sampling phase, and HBM4 is slated for mass production in the second half of 2025, which is expected to further strengthen its position in the high - performance memory market. However, in the broader context of the first few months of 2024, Samsung faced challenges, with a drop in its stock value, unlike some of its competitors.</span></p>\n<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Intel</strong></span></h4>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Intel, a long - standing semiconductor giant, faced some headwinds in 2024. It slipped to the second - place in the global semiconductor rankings. In 2024, its semiconductor revenue was $49.19 billion, with a meager 0.1% year - on - year growth. While there were some bright spots such as growth in the AI PC market and with its Core Ultra chipset, the underperformance of its AI accelerator products and the overall x86 business failed to offset losses in other areas. Intel's ability to regain its footing will depend on its success in ramping up production of advanced chips and effectively competing in the AI - driven semiconductor market.</span></p>\n<h4 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)</strong></span></h4>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, has seen substantial growth. In the second quarter of 2025, TSMC reported a net income of nearly NT398.3 billion, a year - on - year increase of nearly 61%, marking a new high for quarterly net income and the highest growth rate in net income in the same period in nearly three years. This growth was fueled by the surging demand for semiconductors in the AI application field. The company's revenue in the second quarter of 2025 was NT933.792 billion, a 38.65% increase year - on - year and an 11.26% increase quarter - on - quarter. Its gross profit margin in the second quarter of 2025 reached 58.62%, slightly lower than the 58.79% in the first quarter but exceeding the market's previous estimate of 57.9%. Despite challenges such as unfavorable exchange rates and the dilution effect of overseas wafer factories, TSMC maintained strong profitability.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Growth Drivers</strong></span></h3>\n<p class=\"15\" style=\"line-height: 2;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">1. </span><!--[endif]--><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>: The exponential growth of AI has been a game - changer for the semiconductor industry.
